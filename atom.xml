    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Join me Friday, March 22, 2013 as we kick off the first iOS Weekend of 2013.  (<a href="http://www.iosweekend.com">http://www.iosweekend.com</a>)</p>

<p>The focus is on helping you develop practical skills building mobile applications for iOS by building a real application over a weekend.  At iOS Weekend you won&#8217;t get bogged down in mindless study of API calls or every little detail of Objective-C.  What you will do is build a real application from start to finish.  By the time you leave Sunday evening you will have an app running on your phone that you can be proud of.</p>

<p>This course is an introduction to iOS development. You will learn how to build applications using Xcode, iOS and the UIKit framework. You will have a better appreciation of how developers build iOS applications, having built one yourself once you complete the class. The full process for turning ideas into mobile applications sold through the Apple iTunes Store will be discussed.</p>

<p>You will build an iPhone application called &#8220;Count&#8217;em UP&#8221; over the course of 2 1/2 days. The class is 100% hands-on development with class size kept to a minimum so there will be plenty of one-on-one assistance as you work through the class exercises.  Using guided demonstrations and a mix of follow-along exercises and hands-on experimentation you will see &#8220;Count&#8217;em UP&#8221; come to life.</p>

<p>You will receive a complete design specification for the application on the first day of the class. This will include some user stories, wireframe models from a graphic designer, pixel-perfect Photoshop files, all design elements (icons, font, color and animation specifications) and an object-model diagram to get you started.  Here&#8217;s a short video illustrating what you can expect. (<a href="http://files.iosweekend.com/movies/Counters_revisions.mp4">http://files.iosweekend.com/movies/Counters_revisions.mp4</a>)</p>

<p>This course will be valuable if you are a &#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Professional developer wishing to transition from desktop or web development to mobile development.</li>
<li>Graphic designer wishing to get a better understanding of mobile application development for iOS.</li>
<li>Product managers responsible for delivering iOS applications and wishing to understand what it takes to go live in the Apple iTunes Store.</li>
<li>Entreprenuar with and idea who is planning to build a minimally viable product (MVP).</li>
<li>Hobbyist curious about how to build applications for iOS.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hope to see you there!</p>

    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2011/12/comcast-support-problems-surfboard-sbg6580-intermittent-connection-loss</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I finally got fed up with the frequent momentary disconnects that I was experiencing with Comcast. The cable modem/gateway device I have is a Motorola SURFboard SBG6580. I purchased this modem from Amazon after researching which models were supported by Comcast using the information on <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/">this page</a>. Device details are available <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/device.php?tier=-1&amp;devid=268&amp;e=0&amp;d3=1&amp;s=&amp;so=&amp;sc=228">here</a>. It is important to note that this is a currently supported option for connecting to the Comcast network.</p>

<p>Here is some information about the modem, as reported by accessing the web interface to the modem.</p>

<pre>Standard Specification Compliant   DOCSIS 3.0
Hardware Version    1
Software Version    <b>SBG6580-3.1.0.0-GA-07-180-NOSH</b>
Cable Modem MAC Address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
Cable Modem Serial Number   324369118008466559530006
CM certificate  Installed
</pre>


<p>Looking in the logs of my gateway device I noticed a number of critical error messages. Below is an excerpt of the logs currently on my device. One of the errors that comes up repeatedly is a <em>T3 time-out</em>. If you run google searches on this you will learn that many Comcast subscribers (and other cable providers too) see this error in conjunction with intermittent disconnects from their service.</p>

<p>I have reproduced the log of errors from the modem at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>After a lot of reading of forum posts on <a href="http://forums.comcast.com">http://forums.comcast.com</a> I have learned that many people have similar issues.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Connectivity-and-Modem-Help/Internet-Connection-Drops-off-Many-Times-Daily/td-p/1045607">Internet Connection Drops off Many Times Daily</a></li>
</ul>


<p>What all of these have in common is that after repeated suggestions from Comcast that it was a modem issue or an in-house wiring issue, and after customers in some cases spent money to swap out hardware, none of that helped to resolve the issue. The issue is most likely something <em>upstream</em> of the house, but other possibilities exist too.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that the firmware on this model is very old (and riddled with bugs) and that Motorola has made a number of updates to the firmware. You can read an interesting thread about trying to get the firmware upgraded <a href="http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Connectivity-and-Modem-Help/SBG6580-How-to-get-firmware-upgrade/td-p/976719">here</a>.</p>

<p>I found references to the following firmware versions being available from Motorola to the carriers.</p>

<ul>
<li>SBG6580-3.2.1.0-GA-02-249-NOSH</li>
<li>SBG6580-3.3.0.0-GA-06-022-NOSH</li>
</ul>


<p>Every networking device except a basic switch or hub has firmware in it that can be field upgraded. Most knowledgable customers are aware of this and have probably done at least one firmware upgrade of a networking device. The Motorola SURFboard 6580 is no different. The firmware can be upgraded. The problem is, Motorola will not provide the firmware to end consumers. <a href="http://broadband.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/17811">Here</a> is a support document from Motorola about their cable modems and the policies about firmware upgrades. To quote,</p>

<blockquote><p>We apologize about the inconvenience, but your Motorola modem does not support manual upgrades. Motorola is not allowed to control the upgrades of DOCSIS devices, per the standards specification. Any firmware or software changes must be implemented via the cable network. Your cable provider can update the firmware based on what they have approved for their network distribution. Because of that Motorola is not capable of installing firmware for cable modems. Please contact the cable operator to obtain information on upgrading firmware on the cable modem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Repeated calls to Comcast Customer Service (1-800-XFINITY / 1-800-934-6489) got me no where. I spent approximately two hours on the phone with them. I was disconnected three times, had it suggested to me that the problem was the modem multiple times and was offered the option of paying them for <em>Signature Support</em>, but at no time were they able to actually provide me with updated firmware for the modem.</p>

<ul>
<li>They were able to remotely reset the modem.</li>
<li>They studied the connection history and noted that indeed the line had been failing intermittently.</li>
<li>They were not at all interested in the content of the log messages I shared below.</li>
<li>They could not offer any explanation for the log messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>In summary, they were no help what so ever.</p>

<p>After reading about lack of firmware upgrades and my experience with their customer service folks I began to question whether <t>Comcast Cares(™)</i> about subscribers at all.</p>

<p>I wonder how many Comcast subscribers have similar problems with intermittent connection loss and just live with it. A survey of forum posts on their own site seems to indicate that the issues are wide spread.</p>

<p>This is truly a terrible situation. Customers purchase devices that Comcast recommends and then when something goes wrong with the service they place all of the blame on the in-house equipment and offer no support what so ever. The cable service providers have things structured such that consumers cannot get support for the devices from the manufacturers because that is the “service agreement” between the manufacturers and cable providers. Customers get squeezed in the middle without any recourse.</p>

<p>According to another site there are <a href="http://www.teltub.com/forum/index.php?topic=45.0">known problems</a> with the Motorola SURFboard, especially with VOIP. I suspect these problems could be addressed with a firmware update, but we have already established that Comcast is in no mood to provide the necessary updates.</p>

<p>As a last-ditch effort I am now going to place the SURFboard SBG6580 into bridge mode and use a separate router. I found instructions for doing this on Anthony Volodkin’s blog, <a href="http://fascinated.fm/post/2379188731/getting-a-motorola-sbg6580-into-bridge-mode-on">here</a>. I will use my Apple AirPort Extreme (which Apple happily provides firmware updates for) as my router.</p>

<p>In a few days/weeks I will post a follow-up to let people know if this <em>solved</em> the intermittent connection loss problems.</p>

    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2011/08/capturing-airport-extreme-log-with-lion-server-syslog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mac OS X Lion Server can be used as a syslog server to capture the log messages from an Apple AirPort Extreme wireless router. The instructions below walk you through setting this up.</p>

<p>Syslog is controlled by a plist file found in the launch daemons directory. The full path to the file is:</p>

<pre>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
</pre>


<p>You need to edit this file to add a network listener. The plist is stored in a binary format so you need to use the plutil to convert it to XML using this command:</p>

<pre>$ pushd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons
$ sudo plutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo vim /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo plutil -convert binary1 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
</pre>


<p>Here is a complete example of the modified plist file. The new key is the NetworkListener. Be sure you add it nested inside the Sockets key or it will not work.</p>

        &lt;/dict&gt;
        &lt;key&gt;BSDSystemLogger&lt;/key&gt;
        &lt;dict&gt;
            &lt;key&gt;SockPathMode&lt;/key&gt;

            &lt;key&gt;SockType&lt;/key&gt;
            &lt;string&gt;dgram&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Once you have updated the plist the next step is to update the configuration of your AirPort Extreme. Under Applications => Utilities open the AirPort Utility and connect to your AirPort Extreme. On the Advanced tab select the “Logging &amp; Statistics” panel. Enter the IP address of your Mac OS X Lion Server in “Syslog Destination Address:” and select “6 – Informational” for the “Syslog Level:”. You can see a screenshot of the AirPort Utility settings below. Update the settings on the AirPort Extreme.</p>

<div>
  <img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-09083214-AirPort-Utility-Focal-Shift-AirPort-Extreme.png" alt="AirPort Extreme Advanced Configuration" title="[2011-08-09083214]  AirPort Utility-Focal Shift AirPort Extreme.png" border="0" width="320" height="318" />
</div>


<p>Now, you probably want to verify that the logging is actually happening. Open Console.app on your server and look at “All Messages”. While looking at the logs go to another machine (I used my MacBook Air with a wireless connection to the AirPort Extreme) and open System Preferences and then Network. Select your network adapter and ask for it to renew the DHCP lease. You should see some activity in the log.</p>

<p>Another way to verify the logging is to turn wifi off on your laptop. You should see a message like this:</p>

<pre>8/9/11 8:43:09.000 AM 80211: Disassociated with station 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0
</pre>


<p>When you turn wifi back on you will see something similar to this:</p>

<pre>8/9/11 8:43:10.000 AM 80211: Rotated TKIP group key.
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM 80211: Associated with station 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM 80211: Authenticating station 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0 to RADIUS.
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM 80211: Installed unicast CCMP key for supplicant 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM natpmp: Binding added for udp, 173.164.164.17:32770 to 10.0.1.104:4500 with lifetime 7200
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM natpmp: Binding added for udp, 173.164.164.17:32771 to 10.0.1.104:5353 with lifetime 7200
</pre>


<p>That’s it. You now have syslog data being captured on your Mac OS X Lion server from your AirPort Extreme base station!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2011/07/how-i-setup-ubuntu-11-04-server-using-virtualbox-on-a-macbook-air/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-22T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2011/07/how-i-setup-ubuntu-11-04-server-using-virtualbox-on-a-macbook-air</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Download and install the latest version of VirtualBox from http://www.virtualbox.org. As I write this article the current version is 4.1.</p>

<p>Download the Ubuntu 11.04 Server .ISO file from http://www.ubuntu.com. I first tried the 64-bit version but it seems that VirtualBox has trouble with it. The 32-bit version worked just fine, and for the sort of development tasks I am planning it will be okay so I didn’t look any further into why the 64-bit version failed to install.</p>

<p>Create a new virtual machine. I called mine “ubuntu-11.04″. This one will be used as a basis for other machines I clone.  I went with 512MB of RAM and 40GB of hard drive space, making sure that the hard drive was configured to grow dynamically.  I accepted all of the default settings during the installation process. I did not install any additional packages at this stage.  Since I plan on using Vagrant (http://vagrantup.com) to manage my virtual machines I chose to name this machine ubuntu and gave it a user name of “Vagrant Manager” with a login of “vagrant” and a password of “vagrant”.</p>

<p>Shutdown the virtual machine and then create a snapshot (I called mine “Fresh Install”).</p>

<p>You are now ready to create a clone of this machine and start playing around.  Right-click on the virtual machine you just created and select “Clone…” from the context menu.  Give your new virtual machine a unique name and be sure to check the “Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards” option. I assigned the name “vagrant-ubuntu-natty” since that is in keeping with the conventions mentioned on the Vagrant site. I choose to only clone the current machine state.</p>

<p>Boot up the new virtual machine once the clone operation completes.  Log in using vagrant/vagrant.  You will now need to correct issues with the ethernet drivers.  Basically, when you asked VirtualBox to reinitialize the MAC addresses it caused the operating system to no longer recognize the virtual ethernet adapter hardware.  The steps to correct this are:</p>

<pre>sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</pre>




<pre>sudo service udev restart</pre>




<pre>sudo shutdown -r now</pre>


<p>By running these three commands your virtual machine will be reconfigured to now recognize the new virtual ethernet adapters with their reinitialized MAC addresses.</p>

<p>Now you can proceed to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions software.  Start by updating the Ubuntu software using these commands:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get update</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get -y upgrade</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get -y install linux-headers-$(uname -r)</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get -y install dkms</pre>




<pre>sudo shutdown -r now</pre>


<p>At this point you are actually ready to do the installation of the Guest Additions. From the Devices menu in VirtualBox select the “Install Guest Additions…” menu item. This will “insert” the CD containing the guest additions software into the virtual machine.Now, from your virtual machine run the following commands.</p>

<pre>sudo mkdir /tmp/cdrom</pre>




<pre>sudo mount /dev/cdrom /tmp/cdrom</pre>




<pre>cd /tmp/cdrom</pre>




<pre>sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run</pre>


<p>Note, the installation of the Window System drivers will fail. This is okay; remember, we are running the server variant of Ubuntu and don’t have any of the windowing system components installed.</p>

<p>Now change the hostname for the system so it can be used as a Vagrant base box.</p>

<pre>sudo hostname vagrant-ubuntu-natty.vagrantup.com</pre>


<p>Edit the /etc/hosts file and change the second line where localhost is defined. Set the fully qualified domain name for the host and the short name for the host.</p>

<p>Edit the /etc/hostname file and replace “ubuntu” with “vagrant-ubuntu-natty”.</p>

<p>Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and replace the domain and search values with “vagrantup.com”.</p>

<p>Reboot the machine once more using</p>

<pre>sudo shutdown -r now</pre>


<p>It is now time to setup the rest of the required software on the guest in order for it to be used as a Vagrant base box.</p>

<p>Start by editing /etc/sudoers using</p>

<pre>sudo vim /etc/sudoers</pre>


<p>Add or change the line giving sudo access to administrators to read as follows:</p>

<pre>%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL</pre>


<p>Add the following line right after the “Defaults env_reset” line:</p>

<pre>Defaults env_keep="SSH_AUTH_SOCK"</pre>


<p>Run the command:</p>

<pre>sudo /etc/init.d/sudo restart</pre>


<p>Now setup the software Vagrant relies upon to provide all it’s goodness.</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install -y ruby-dev</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get install -y rubygems</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get install -y puppet</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get install -y chef</pre>




<pre>sudo gem install chef</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get install -y openssh-server openssh-client</pre>


<p>When installing the chef package (above) you will be prompted for the URL of the Chef server. Just press enter here and ignore that step. We are only interested in chef-solo, and this URL is only used by chef-client. The package installer will go ahead and configure the chef client to run automatically. We now need to disable this by running the following command:</p>

<pre>sudo /usr/sbin/update-rc.d chef-client disable</pre>


<p>Edit the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add the following line (case matters here):</p>

<pre>UseDNS no</pre>


<p>Configure a secure key pair for our new Vagrant base box by running the following command on the host system.</p>

<pre>ssh-keygen -P "" -t rsa -C "Some meaningful comment" -f ./vagrant-id_rsa</pre>


<p>This command will create two files in the local directory called vagrant-id_rsa and vagrant-id_rsa.pub.  You will need to copy vagrant-id_rsa.pub into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the guest system. To do this you will need to setup port forwarding between the host and guest. The first step is to learn what the IP address of the host and guest systems are.  Use the following command to view the network adapters that are configured on each system:</p>

<pre>ifconfig</pre>


<p>Run this on both the host and guest. Once you know both IP addresses you need to add a port forwarding rule in Virtual Box for the SSH port. This is done by selecting the “Settings…” menu item from the “Machine” menu.  Once you have the settings dialog box open select the “Network” button and then open the “Advanced” section.  You will see a button labeled “Port Forwarding”. Press it to open the port forwarding rule editor. Here you need to create a rule as follows:</p>

<pre>Name: SSH</pre>




<pre>Protocol: TCP</pre>




<pre>Host IP: &lt;fill in host IP address from ifconfig&gt;</pre>




<pre>Host Port: 9999</pre>




<pre>Guest IP: &lt;fill in guest IP address from ifconfig&gt;</pre>




<pre>Guest Port: 22</pre>


<p>Close the panel and dismiss the settings dialog box. You should now have a port open between the host and the guest for SSH/SCP.  To verify this, enter the following command in a terminal window on the host system.</p>

<pre>ssh -p 9999 vagrant@&lt;host ip address&gt;</pre>


<p>When prompted for a password enter “vagrant”. You should now be in an ssh session on the guest system. If this worked you are ready to propogate the public key generated earlier. You can exit out of the SSH session now by typing exit in the guest. Back on the host type the following command to copy the public key.</p>

<pre>cat vagrant-id_rsa.pub | ssh -p 9999 vagrant@&lt;host ip address&gt; 'sh -c "cat - &gt;&gt;~/.ssh/authorized_keys"'</pre>


<p>You will be prompted for the guest password. Type “vagrant” again. You will now want to test that the key propogated successfully. On the host system enter the following commands.</p>

<pre>ssh-add ./vagrant-id_rsa</pre>




<pre>ssh -p 9999 vagrant@&lt;host ip address&gt;</pre>


<p>If everything worked in the earlier steps you should be in an SSH session on the guest without the need to enter your password!</p>

<p>As a final step before packaging a vagrant base box you should clean things up in the guest by running the following commands:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get clean</pre>




<pre>sudo apt-get autoclean</pre>


<p>You are now ready to package the vagrant base box. Back on the host system in a terminal window first create a Vagrantfile that points to the SSH private key. Here is an example of what it might look like if you decide to copy your key (generated earlier). Call this file Vagrantfile.pkg.</p>

<pre>Vagrant::Config.run do |config|</pre>




<pre>  config.ssh.private_key_path = "lcl-vagrant-id_rsa"</pre>




<pre>end</pre>


<p>Now invoke this command in the terminal window to create the package.</p>

<pre>vagrant package --base vagrant-ubuntu-natty --include lcl-vagrant-id_rsa --vagrantfile Vagrantfile.pkg</pre>


<p>The packaging takes a little while. Once it completes you should test the base box using these steps:</p>

<pre>mv package.box vagrant-ubuntu-natty.box</pre>




<pre>vagrant box add lclbase32 vagrant-ubuntu-natty.box</pre>




<pre>mkdir test_environment</pre>




<pre>cd test_environment</pre>




<pre>vagrant init lclbase32</pre>




<pre>vagrant up</pre>




<pre>vagrant ssh</pre>


<p>If all went well you are now finished with building a Vagrant base box. Congratulations!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After watching from the side lines for a few years as git gathered a following I finally made the switch out of necessity as a result of doing more projects in Ruby on Rails. The projects I work on are all hosted in the cloud (Heroku, Engine Yard, or directly on Amazon EC2). Many of the tools I use support direct deployment from git. So I now find myself migrating all of my projects from subversion to git.</p>

<p>I tend to write down a lot of notes as I learn a new technology or tool. The migration to git is no different. What is different is how GitHub (the hosted git solution I am using) makes it possible to record just about anything in what they call a <em>gist</em>. This is turning out to be a very useful tool for me. It is a great place to store little bits of code or notes.</p>

    <updated>2010-11-15T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/11/adding-mongodb-to-my-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-ruby-on-rails-environment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I wanted to add MongoDB to my Mac OS X Snow Leopard Ruby on Rails Environment. Refer to my <a href="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/11/setting-up-my-snow-leopard-ruby-1-9-2-ruby-on-rails-3-0-nginx-passenger-development-environment/">earlier post</a> for details of how I setup my environment. This post assumes your environment is setup according to the instructions found there.</p>

<p>I wrote the following script to handle installation of MongoDB. I decided to grab the pre-built version of MongoDB from the project site and then place the files under the <tt>/usr/local/ror</tt> directory tree.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

# Get and extract a copy of Mongodb
curl http://fastdl.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.6.4.tgz > mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.6.4.tgz
tar xvf mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.6.4.tgz

curl http://downloads.mongodb.org/docs/mongodb-docs-2010-09-23.pdf > mongodb-docs-2010-09-23.pdf

# Move files into final locations
(
    cd mongodb-osx-x86_64-1.6.4
    sudo cp -R * /usr/local/ror
    sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/ror/GNU* /usr/local/ror/README* /usr/local/ror/THIRD*
    sudo gem install mongo
)

(
    sudo cp mongodb-docs-2010-09-23.pdf /usr/local/ror/share/doc/mongodb.pdf
    sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/ror/share/doc/mongodb.pdf
)
</pre>


<p>Download the script tarball (<a href="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mongodb.sh.tar" class="s3-link">mongodb.sh.tar</a>), extract it into a folder like <tt>/tmp</tt> and then run <tt>sh ./mongodb.sh</tt>. This will download the MongoDB binaries and place everything in the <tt>/usr/local/ror</tt> tree.</p>

<p>One final step. Since you are running on a Mac you might want to check out a cool MongoDB client called MongoHub. You can learn more and download it from the official <a href="http://mongohub.todayclose.com/">site</a>.</p>

    <updated>2010-11-14T08:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/11/setting-up-my-snow-leopard-ruby-1-9-2-ruby-on-rails-3-0-nginx-passenger-development-environment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snow Leopard ships with Ruby 1.8.7 installed and an older version of Ruby Gems. I am planning on doing some projects with Ruby on Rails and wanted to setup a current environment. My requirements were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby 1.9.2</li>
<li>Rails 3.0</li>
<li>PostgreSQL 9.0</li>
<li>Nginx</li>
<li>Passenger</li>
</ul>


<p>You should download and install the Mac version of PostgreSQL 9.0 from the folks at <a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/download.do">EnterpriseDB</a>. You will need to register on the site in order to do the download. Be sure to download PostgreSQL 9.0.1, not one of their <em>Plus</em> packages. It is a nicely packaged installer for the freely available version of Postgres.</p>

<p>Once you install this software you should have a file called <tt>pg_env.sh</tt> in the <tt>/Library/PostgreSQL/9.0/</tt> directory. This file should be added to your <tt>/etc/profile</tt>. Here is an example of what mine looks like:</p>

<pre># System-wide .profile for sh(1)

# This has to be set to something in order for path_helper (below)
# to update it with paths found in the /etc/manpaths.d directory.
MANPATH=/usr/local/share/man; export MANPATH

# Setup the PostgreSQL environment.
. /Library/PostgreSQL/9.0/pg_env.sh

if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then
    eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`
fi

if [ "${BASH-no}" != "no" ]; then
    [ -r /etc/bashrc ] &#038;&#038; . /etc/bashrc
fi
</pre>


<p>Be sure to log out and log back in before continuing with these instructions. This is important to make sure your PostgreSQL environment variables are set properly.</p>

<p>One of my goals with this setup is to keep everything independent of the default tools that ship with Snow Leopard. To do this I decided that all of my Ruby on Rails setup will be located in the <tt>/usr/local/ror</tt> directory tree. Here is a script I developed to setup my Ruby on Rails development environment.</p>

<pre>#!/bin/bash

# Get and extract a copy of LibYAML
curl http://pyyaml.org/download/libyaml/yaml-0.1.3.tar.gz > yaml-0.1.3.tar.gz
tar xvf yaml-0.1.3.tar.gz

# Build LibYAML
(
    cd yaml-0.1.3
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
)

# Get and extract a copy of Ruby 1.9.2
curl ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org:21//pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.2-p0.tar.gz > ruby-1.9.2-p0.tar.gz
tar xvf ruby-1.9.2-p0.tar.gz

# Build Ruby 1.9.2
(
    cd ruby-1.9.2-p0
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ror --with-arch=x86_64 --enable-shared
    make
    make test
    sudo make install
)

# Update Ruby Gems
sudo gem update --system

# Install Gems
sudo gem install rails
sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
sudo gem install pg
sudo gem install passenger

# Configure Passenger for Nginx (downloads Nginx and PCRE automatically)
sudo passenger-install-nginx-module --prefix=/usr/local/ror --auto-download --auto
</pre>


<p><a href="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/doit.sh.tar" class="s3-link">Download the script</a>, un-tar it and place it in any directory you want. I call the script <tt>doit.sh</tt>, but you can name it anything you like. Run the script using the command shown below.</p>

<pre>$ sh ./doit.sh
</pre>


<p>Once the script completes you need to add <tt>/usr/local/ror/bin</tt> to your path. I did this by editing my <tt>/etc/paths</tt> file. Here is a copy of the file on my machine:</p>

<pre>usr/local/ror/bin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
</pre>


<p>One more logout/login and you are done. Have fun playing with Ruby on Rails on your Mac!</p>

    <updated>2010-10-03T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/10/heading-to-big-nerd-ranch-later-this-month</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the podcasts I listen to on a regular basis is called MacBreak. The hosts are Leo Leporte, Alex Lindsay, Andy Ihnatko and a rotating list of other Mac/Apple/iOS luminaries. If you aren’t familiar with it head over to <a href="http://twit.tv/mbw">http://twit.tv/mbw</a> and have a listen. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in <em>all things Macintosh (and iOS too)</em>.</p>

<p>A few episodes ago Alex Lindsay mentioned that his company was going to be hosting a one week <em>Commuter iOS Class</em> at their San Francisco offices so their team could come up to speed developing applications for iOS devices. The class would be taught by the folks from <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a>. Usually the BNR folks teach classes from their <em>monastery</em> at a secret location just outside Atlanta, Georgia. Having them venture out to San Francisco; wow, what an opportunity. Oh, did I mention that Alex Lindsay also announced that there were a limited number of spots open to <em>the unwashed masses</em> to attend and the class would be held from 2:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. each day so folks could continue to do at least part of their day jobs.</p>

<p>All in all this just sounded too good to pass up so I fired off an e-mail to the folks at BNR to let them know I wanted to attend. My fingers were crossed because I know how quickly their classes fill up. Needless to say I wouldn’t be writing this post if I didn’t get in. <img src='http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

<p>So, I’m off to the <a href="http://www.pixelcorps.com/">Pixel Corps</a> offices later this month to soak up some more iOS goodness. Hope to see a few of you there too.</p>

<p>BTW: Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/classes/commuter_ios_class_with_macbreak_2pm-10pm">course description</a> for anyone curious.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/10/macbook-pro-development-environment/"/>
    <updated>2010-10-01T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/10/macbook-pro-development-environment</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article covers the steps I went through to setup my MacBook Pro for Google App Engine (GAE) development. I am using the Python runtime in GAE so the focus here is on a Python development environment.</p>

<h1>Python</h1>

<h2>Setting Python 2.5 as Default</h2>

<p>My MacBook Pro is running Snow Leopard. I am planning to host my projects on Google App Engine and it requires Python 2.5. Snow Leopard ships with Python 2.6 as the default. You can switch to Python 2.5 using a few simple commands, as follows:</p>

<pre>$ defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.5
$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.5
</pre>


<p>After issuing these commands you should logout and login, launch a Terminal window and issue the command</p>

<pre>$ python --version
</pre>


<p>It should report <tt>Python 2.5.4</tt> as the result. If it still says <tt>Python 2.6.1</tt> then your change did not take effect. To troubleshoot the problem start with <tt>man python</tt>. It includes information on how to switch the default version of Python on your system.</p>

<h2>Additional Python Modules</h2>

<p>Google App Engine expects that the ssl module is installed. This is so it can verify the identity of the GAE servers when trying to deploy your projects. Install it like this:</p>

<pre>$ curl http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/ssl/ssl-1.15.tar.gz --output ssl-1.15.tar.gz
$ tar xvf ssl-1.15.tar.gz
$ cd ssl-1.15
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>


<p>If you want to use the GAE image manipulation classes while running on the local development server you will need to install PIL using the following command.</p>

<pre>$ sudo easy_install pil
</pre>


<p>The following will be necessary for building some other python libraries later in the process.</p>

<pre>$ sudo easy_install docutils
</pre>


<p>The following modules are necessary if you choose to install IPython (see next section). If you are planning on skipping the IPython installation these can be skipped as well.</p>

<pre>$ sudo easy_install readline
$ sudo easy_install nose
$ sudo easy_install pexpect
</pre>


<h2>IPython</h2>

<p>The IPython interactive interpreter is a good addition to your Python development environment. It does not come pre-installed on Snow Leopard. You can download the latest stable version using this command:</p>

<pre>$ curl http://ipython.scipy.org/dist/0.10/ipython-0.10.tar.gz --output ipython-0.10.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf ipython-0.10.tar.gz
$ cd ipython
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>


<h1>Google App Engine SDK</h1>

<p>The Google App Engine SDK for Python is available at http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html. As of this writing you can use the following command to grab the latest version:</p>

<pre>$ curl http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/GoogleAppEngineLauncher-1.3.7.dmg --output GoogleAppEngineLauncher-1.3.7.dmg
</pre>


<p>Once you download the <tt>dmg</tt> file open it in Finder and run the installer. It will place all of the necessary files on your machine. Once complete locate the <em>GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app</em> icon in Finder and double-click on it. This application provides a nice UI for managing your GAE projects.</p>

<h1>Source Code Management Tools</h1>

<h2>Git</h2>

<p>I am planning on managing the source code for my projects with <tt>git</tt> and will store my master repositories on <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a>. Apple does not include a copy of <tt>git</tt> on the machine by default. An installer is available at <a href="http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/">http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/</a>. While you are at it also create an account on github if you don’t already have one. It is useful for <em>social coding</em> in the wider open-source community.</p>

<h2>Mercurial</h2>

<p>Some of the Django open source software I plan on using is maintained using a distributed source control management tool called Mercurial. An installer for this is available at <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com">http://mercurial.selenic.com</a>. Download and install the software.</p>

<pre>$ curl http://mercurial.selenic.com/release/mercurial-1.6.3.tar.gz --output mercurial-1.6.3.tar.gz
$ tar xvf mercurial-1.6.3.tar.gz
$ cd mercurial-1.6.3
$ make PREFIX=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5 all
$ sudo make PREFIX=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5 install
$ hg version
</pre>


<h1>Django-nonrel</h1>

<p>I plan on implementing my web applications on top of the Django framework. Some modifications are required in order for this framework to run properly on GAE since Google uses <em>Big Table</em> for data storage instead of a relational database. Everything necessary to get Django working in GAE is included as part of the <a href="http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel">Django-nonrel</a> project. Specific instructions for GAE are available at <a href="http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine">http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine</a>.</p>

<p>Use the commands listed below to install copies of all the necessary components onto your machine. Everything will be stored in a folder called <tt>DjangoStuff</tt> under your home directory.</p>

<pre>$ mkdir $HOME/DjangoStuff
$ cd $HOME/DjangoStuff
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-nonrel
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/djangoappengine
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/djangotoolbox
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-dbindexer
$ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-testapp
</pre>


<p>Now, pick another folder where you want to setup a practice application. I am calling mine <tt>cs-practice</tt> since this is also the name of my Google App Engine application.</p>

<p>Use the following commands to configure the practice application for Django-nonrel development.</p>

<pre>$ mkdir $HOME/cs-practice
$ cd $HOME/cs-practice
$ ln -s $HOME/DjangoStuff/django-nonrel/django django
$ ln -s $HOME/DjangoStuff/djangoappengine djangoappengine
$ ln -s $HOME/DjangoStuff/djangotoolbox/djangotoolbox djangotoolbox
$ ln -s $HOME/DjangoStuff/django-dbindexer/dbindexer dbindexer
$ cp -r $HOME/DjangoStuff/django-testapp/* .
</pre>


<p>Once you have the practice folder setup you need to edit the <tt>app.yaml</tt> file and change the application name to reflect the Google App Engine application name you selected when registering on <a href="http://appengine.google.com">http://appengine.google.com</a>.</p>

I am attending the yearly iOSDevCamp event this weekend in SanJose, CA. This is a great event where iPhone/iPad software developers and UI/UX designers come together for a weekend of coding and exploration of ideas around how to use iOS devices. The event organizers hold something called a Hackathon where attendees form ad-hoc teams around shared application ideas and spend two full days designing and coding like crazy to build something cool. Everyone has a great time and meets like-minded folks in the developer community.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, in April the event organizers held a special iPadDevCamp. That was my first exposure to this great event format. You can read more about that experience over on the <a href="http://blog.poweredbyamp.com/marketplace-platform/seller-dashboard-ipad/">Powered By AMP</a> blog. For that event I was on a team with some co-workers from <a href="www.auctiva.com">Auctiva</a>. We built a prototype of an e-commerce sales management tool for AMP sellers.</p>

<p>This time I’m attending solo, without a cadre of other Auctiva designers and developers. I want to explore developing location-aware applications for the iPhone and put together a basic idea for an app. It is called Meet4Drinks, and you can read more about it at <a href="http://www.meet4drinks.net">http://www.meet4drinks.net</a>.</p>

<p>If it sounds like something you would enjoy, it’s not too late to register today. The event starts tomorrow (Friday) evening and goes through Sunday evening. Visit <a href="http://www.iosdevcamp.org">http://www.iosdevcamp.org</a> to register.</p>

<p>Look for updates on Meet4Drinks next week, once my head is back above water after the event. Hope to see you there.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/08/imac-bluetooth-problems-gone-but-how/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-01T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/08/imac-bluetooth-problems-gone-but-how</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My 27″ iMac has been having some very strange bluetooth problems lately. As mentioned in a recent blog post, all bluetooth devices were <em>unavailable</em> according to the operating system. Reboots didn’t fix the problem. Checking through the console logs turned up messages about the bluetooth drivers not working properly. Fortunately I had a USB keyboard so I was able to make a full backup of the system before scheduling an appointment with the genius at the Apple Store.</p>

<p>Now it has been a couple weeks and I have the machine back and Apple didn’t find anything wrong. In fact, they say the bluetooth works fine. I turned everything on and it works fine here too. I had a hunch that this might be the case. Last week my 13″ MBP had the exact same issue. No bluetooth devices would work with it. In this case a full reboot did correct the problem.</p>

<p>So, what bluetooth devices do I have, and which one is misbehaving and causing all of these problems? I don’t know for sure, but I suspect either the new iPhone 4 or the Plantronics Bluetooth Headset I have. The Apple Bluetooth Keyboard and Magic Mouse seem to be working fine. I have noticed other issues with the bluetooth on the iPhone 4 when it syncs with the Alpine IWA-505 head unit in my truck so my money is on the iPhone 4 being the cause in all of these bluetooth problems. Time will tell.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I sat down at my 27″ iMac to get a little work done. The first thing I do is tap the keyboard and move the mouse to wake the machine from sleep mode. The machine awoke and then quickly displayed the <em>Connection Lost</em> graphics in the middle of the screen for both the mouse and keyboard. My first thought; no problem, it’s just the batteries so I replaced them. Still no connection (and it did seem kind of odd for both the mouse and keyboard batteries to be dead at the same time.) Looking up at the system tray I see an odd Bluetooth icon. Here’s a closeup of what I found:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/LittleSnapper.png" alt="LittleSnapper.png" border="0" width="280" height="69" align="center" />
</div>


<p>The <em>Bluetooth: Not Available</em> message in the system tray is not a good sign. Next I opened up <em>Console.app</em> to see if there were any indications of what the root cause for this behavior was. It appears there is truly something wrong with the Bluetooth Module. Here is what it showed:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>


<p>A visit to the support forums at Apple led me to an idea to reset the SMC on the iMac. I tried that and still nothing. At this point I’m not a happy camper. It is looking like the Bluetooth Module in my iMac has given up the ghost.</p>

<p>Next step, the iPhone Apple AppStore application to make a Genius Bar appointment.</p>

</div>


<p>If you have read this far then you might be wondering why I’m telling you all of this. The reason is simple. Without a USB keyboard and mouse laying around somewhere none of the troubleshooting above would have been possible. Having a wireless bluetooth keyboard and mouse ship by default with the iMac is a really odd choice on Apple’s part.</p>

<p>Thankfully I have a keyboard and mouse from the Xserve in my garage. In case you forgot what these old fashion beasts look like, here’s a picture of the dynamic duo that saved my bacon tonight!</p>

<p>For years I have been developing Windows applications on my MacBook Pro. When other developers ask me why my response is usually something like “The best windows development system I have is my MacBook Pro.” It is fast, the hardware build quality is excellent and best of all, with Parallels Desktop I can have the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>This weekend I saw a tweet from the folks over at Parallels that was part of their <a href="http://blogs.parallels.com/consumertech/2010/05/the-luckiest-number-7-day-contest-for-windows-7.html">promotion</a> to get people to upgrade to Windows 7. It was a contest to win a copy of Windows 7. Guess what – yup, I won! Check it out over on the <a href="http://blogs.parallels.com/consumertech/2010/05/they-call-him-smith-bennett-smith-3-days-left-to-win-a-copy-of-windows-7.html">Parallels Consumer Tech Blog</a>.</p>

    <updated>2010-05-01T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/05/ipad-as-technical-book-reader-absolutely</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been lugging around technical books for the last 20+ years as part of my profession. The pace with which technology changes means there is a constant stream of new topics to study and that usually means buying books. The thing about many of these technology books is you don’t read them like a pleasure book. You tend to use them as a reference while you climb a new learning curve. It goes kind of like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft, Apple or someone else releases a new operating system or application. => More books</li>
<li>Open source tools like Subversion, Git or whatever gains in popularity. => More books</li>
<li>Start developing in a new language (Ruby, Python, Objective-C, …) => More books</li>
</ul>


<p>The end result is that my garage is always full of books that either describe out of date technology or are still current but not relavent for the projects I am working on at the moment. Worst still, the books I am currently using usually end up weighing many pounds and take up a lot of room.</p>

<div style="float: right; padding: 8px;">
  <img src="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/leaning_tower_of_books.jpg" alt="" title="leaning_tower_of_books" width="240" height="320" align="right" class="alignright size-full wp-image-343" />
</div>


<p>The difference between carrying around a bunch of paper books and an e-book reader is huge. This stack of books weighs in at 31.8 lbs. Compare that with an iPad that has most of the same books loaded onto it and weights just 1.8 lbs. I know which one I am going to be carrying in my backpack.</p>

<p>Early last year when Amazon released the Kindle2 I purchased one hoping to get rid of this problem by switching to e-books instead of paper books. I did a survey of the technical e-books available and it looked promising. Most of the books I was either currently using or would likely be interested in were now available from Amazon in an e-book version. Amazon made it possible for the Kindle to also read the mobi format so that meant I could also get books from The Pragmatic Programmer and O’Reilly.</p>

<p>You know what they say about the best laid plans and all that. The Kindle worked as advertised. I switched almost exclusively to e-books on the Kindle. The problem was, many of these technical books include figures or illustrations <strong>that are in color</strong> and the Kindle did an awfull job of displaying them. To make matters worse, you couldn’t change the orientation of the Kindle (no landscape mode) so images that didn’t scale well could not be viewed by rotating the device. This was almost enough for me to go back to paper books.</p>

<p>Flash forward about a year and the rumors were flying about Apple building a tablet/slate of some sort. Would it be a book reader, a netbook computer, a movie viewer or what? No one knew for sure but everyone was speculating. Then the announcement came that Apple would hold a special event to announce “Something they have been working on”. My Kindle2 went up on craigslist that day (about a week before the special event was held) and I sold it the next day. I love craigslist; it just works! The ironic part is I sold it to a software engineer who works for Apple.</p>

<p>We all know what happened next. Steve told us all what we needed (an iPad) and when we would be giving him our money. I listened, reserved one for pickup on the release day and the rest is history. Apple ships the iPad with an e-book reader called iBooks and they have an on-line bookstore where you can purchase e-books. Amazon shipped a Kindle reader for the iPad that uses wifi to sync with the Kindle on-line bookstore.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of my new 1.8 lb iPad that makes an excellent technical book reader.</p>

<div style="float: left; padding: 8px;">
  <img src="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ipad_under_2lbs.jpg" alt="" title="ipad_under_2lbs" width="240" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-344" />
</div>


<p>All of my existing Kindle books transfered over to the iPad without any trouble. The Pragmatic Programmer books I had were all in the mobi format which the Kindle software on the iPad cannot read. No problem – I just downloaded the epub format of the same books from the Pragmatic Programmer on-line bookstore.</p>

<p>Publishers sell their e-books in one or more of the following formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF – Adobe format that permits publishers to lock the content down with DRM. In some cases they can be very restrictive about which applications you are able to read the books in. My advice is to avoid purchasing e-books from publishers who use this format unless they are DRM-free and also offer one of the following formats. There just isn’t any reason for you to be locked into PDF when the iPad is such a great reader.</li>
<li>mobi – A mobile electronic book format that was very popular when the PocketPC and Palm were in their hayday. You can read mobi files with the Kindle device, but not with the Kindle software on the iPad.</li>
<li>epub – Modern electronic book format. Supported in the Apple iBooks application. This is the best choice for an open format on the iPad right now. I favor epub over other formats. A very nice feature of the iBooks applications is the ability to search through books.</li>
<li>Amazon – Proprietary format from Amazon. The Kindle reader software for the iPad is excellent so if a book is only available from the Kindle store I go ahead and purchase it there with no regrets. The only downside right now is the lack of a good search feature in the Kindle software. Hopefully they will be correcting this in an update.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>As an aside, everyone should make their e-books available like the folks at PragProg do. When you buy a book from them you get it in three formats (PDF, mobi and epub). This means you can read your book on basically any electronic device of your choosing. O’Reilly is almost as good.</p></blockquote>

<p>To round things out here are a couple pictures of the user interface of iBooks and Kindle Reader for iPad.</p>

<p>This first two images are of the iBooks software. The image on the left illustrates the support for color and the nice page turn animations help you forget that this is not paper after a while. As is typical of most Apple user interfaces, this one has excellent usability. On the right you have a look at the search feature as implemented in the iBooks application. I have found that it works well, but is a bit slow. I would like to see Apple improve on the performance in an update.</p>

<div width="100%">

    <img src="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ibooks_vert_pageturn.jpg" alt="" title="ibooks_vert_pageturn" width="240" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-336" />
  </div>

  </div>
</div>


<p>The next image is of the Amazon Kindle for iPad software. Here I am showing you what the controls are like for selecting a font size and adjusting the background color and brightness. As I mentioned earlier, the main thing missing from the Kindle software is a search feature.</p>

<div  style="float: left; padding: 8px;">
  <img src="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/kindle_font.jpg" alt="" title="kindle_font" width="240" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" />
</div>


<p>I would really like to have all my e-books in a single reader. Being forced to keep some in iBooks and others in the Kindle application really sucks, but I’m not holding my breath for a solution anytime soon.</p>

<p>Technical books are often used as references. Neither of the e-book reading applications do a good job with letting you keep multiple books open and rapidly switch between them. It would really improve the usefulness of the applications if you could keep more than one book open and use a multi-touch gesture to switch between them.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an iPad yet, run (don’t walk) to your nearest Apple store and pick one up. You won’t regret it.</p>

<p>The folks over at <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a> are really busy these days. In addition to building a new learning center it looks like they are writing no less than three new books to be released this year. If you have ever read through <em>Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X</em> by Aaron Hillegass or had the fortune to attend one of his classes then you already know that these new books will likely become a core part of your programming library in the future.</p>

<p>The first new title is <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/iphone_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide"><em>iPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em>, written by Joe Conway and Aaron Hillegass</a>. According to Amazon this book will be available for purchase on May 4th in paper form and May 6th for the Kindle. You can pre-order it now.</p>

<div style="float: left;">
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS/dp/0321706269/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_3"><img src="http://wp-media.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/more_cocoa_programming_bnr.jpg" alt="" title="more_cocoa_programming_bnr" width="300" height="300" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-386" /></a>
</div>


<p>The second new book is titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Cocoa-Programming-Mac-OS/dp/0321706269/ref=pd_rhf_p_t_3"><em>More Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em></a> and is being written by Aaron Hillegass and Juan Pablo Claude. According to Amazon’s web site this book will be available in mid-July, 2010. At this point it appears the book will only be available in print form. Hopefully this will change and a Kindle version will be made available.</p>

<p>The third new book will be titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Objective-C-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321706285/ref=pd_sim_b_40"><em>Objective-C Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em></a> and is being written by Aaron Hillegass and Mark Fenoglio. Amazon pegs the release of this book sometime in December, 2010. Cover art for this book has not been released yet.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/04/ipad-review-first-24-hours/"/>
    <updated>2010-04-05T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/04/ipad-review-first-24-hours</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My experience with it so far is mixed. Like you I tried to touch-type on the keyboard and that really didn’t work at all. I have tried to do the two finger plus thumbs approach and am not that fast typing like that. The keyboard is big enough that I find it kind of weird to hold it in one hand and type with the other. My hand has to move too far to get all the keys unlike on the iPhone where everything is much closer together. I have not tried to hook up a bluetooth keyboard yet either. I expect that to work much better for things like typing e-mails.</p>

<p>I ended up purchasing the 64GB version instead of the 16GB version. The change was based on a recommendation I heard on MacBreak Weekly. They mentioned that based on their preview use (had it for about a week before April 3rd) they feel that if you are going to use it to read books then you will easily fill the 16GB and then have to pick/choose which items to sync to your iPad. With the 64GB version you can just dump all the books/PDFs you want on it and not worry about running out of space.</p>

<p>I have the Kindle for iPad application on it and pulled down all my Kindle books. Very cool! It just works! I also downloaded the iBooks application from the App Store. That application reads the ePub format. I have purchased a number of technical books in the past few years from Pragmatic Programmers. All of their books are available in ePub format so I downloaded that version and loaded them into the iPad too.</p>

<p>So far I really like having all of my technical books in one place like this. I have not tried reading out in full sunlight, but expect it will be an issue. For reading indoors it works fine. Not as easy on the eyes as the Kindle, but it shows all of the technical illustrations in the books in full color which is much better.</p>

<p>I purchased the Pages, Numbers and Keynote applications from Apple also. They really show off the sort of things you can accomplish with the iPad, but the crash a lot. I feel more like a beta tester of these apps than just a user. Sort of a let down, but then I have been here before with other Apple products. Eventually these will be great applications.</p>

<p>With the iPad I also purchased the Apple case for the iPad. I was really surprised when I opened it up at home. The quality of the case is really bad. It only cost $39, but it sucks compared to the case that Amazon sells for the Kindle. After about 2 hours of using the iPad in the case I got so annoyed with it that now I am using the iPad without a case. I am shopping for a different case now.</p>

<p>I have had Safari crash on me more than once now on the iPad. It seems like the crashes were always on very long (lots of scrolling) web pages so maybe it is a memory issue. I’m not sure, but the end result is you are just reading along on the page and all of a sudden you are back to the menu of icons wondering how you got there.</p>

<p>Even more surprising than the crashes of apps on the device is the crash I experienced this morning of the Xcode development environment on the desktop. Apple released an update to Xcode that includes all of the iPad development tools yesterday. I was working on a sample application this morning, following the instructions on how to build an app when all of a sudden Xcode just up and crashed on me. This is very unusual. Earlier versions of Xcode have been very stable for years.</p>

<p>Over all I think purchasing one as a developer at this point is a good move, but for basic consumers it is probably more sensible to wait about 3 months before jumping on the iPad bandwagon.</p>

    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2009/12/software-developers-are-human-beings</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over on the “Shaping Software” site they just posted a short article titled <a href="http://shapingsoftware.com/2009/12/07/lessons-in-software-from-eric-brechner/">“Lessons in Software from Eric Brechner.”</a> Eric is the Director of Development Excellence on the Engineering Excellence team at Microsoft. The article focuses on his insights about what attributes shape developers into software engineers. He suggests that strength and balance attributes are important. Briefly, they are enumerated as follows:</p>

<h2>Strength attributes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Insightful</li>
<li>Reflective</li>
<li>Principled</li>
</ul>


<h2>Balance attributes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Serving and advocating</li>
<li>Eecution and slack</li>
<li>Trust and risk</li>
</ul>


<p>I really enjoy reading articles like this where the author focuses on the human side of software engineering. As Eric says, <em>You can’t accomplish anything truly impactful alone</em>.</p>

<p>I think it is worth the time to read through this article! Highly recommended.</p>
