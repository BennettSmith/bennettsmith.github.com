[prMac.com] Livermore, California - FocalShift, LLC today is thrilled to announce its upcoming Beginning iOS Programming Course, to be held from March 22 - 24 at the Courtyard Marriott Silicon Valley in Fremont, conveniently located in the southern Bay Area. The two-and-a-half day, weekend course is designed to quickly bring developers, product managers, and designers up to speed on developing iPhone applications. All participants build an actual, working application from the ground up and learn the four-part process for developing applications: Idea, Design, Development, and Release.

The Course is taught by software architect, OS X, and iOS developer Bennett Smith, a serial startup junkie who loves hiking and mountain biking. A highly successful instructor, Bennett has 30+ years experience with Apple software development.

The Beginning iOS Programming Course is a hands-on introduction to iOS development. With the focus on learning by doing, course participants move through a series of structured exercises using Xcode. Far more efficient than self-teaching methods, participants receive immediate, expert assistance and advice at every step. Bennett Smith and FocalShift co-owner Terry Tucker will both be present, providing one-on-one assistance during the hands-on exercises. In addition to the five regularly scheduled sessions, the Course includes open evening lab time.

Course Topics:

- Using Xcode to build and debug iOS applications
- Classes, objects, class categories, protocols, properties, and blocks
- Cocoa/Objective-C design patterns (target-action, delegate, model-view-controller)
- User interface design using Interface Builder and the Auto-layout system
- Proper structure for Cocoa Touch applications
- Navigation
- Table Views
- Gesture Recognizers
- Core Animation
- Persistent storage with iCloud
- Using the iOS Provisioning Portal
- Code signing, provisioning profiles, and the process for submitting applications to iTunes Connect

Who Should Come:

- Professional Developers wishing to transition from desktop or web development to mobile development
- Graphic Designers wishing to get a better understanding of mobile application development for iOS
- Product Managers responsible for delivering iOS applications and wishing to understand what it takes to go live in the Apple iTunes Store
- Entrepreneurs with an idea, who are planning to build a minimally viable product (MVP)
- Hobbyists curious about how to build applications for iOS

"In a sea of me-too iOS training courses, what sets iOS Weekend apart is our approach to learning," stated Bennett Smith of FocalShift. "Each weekend workshop is a guided exercise in building a complete iOS application. We take you through all the steps required to make sure that when you leave the class at the end of the weekend, you have a working application running on your iPhone or iPad. Training classes are offered in the San Francisco Bay Area, and future classes are planned for the greater San Diego Area and Portland. Hope to see you at the next iOS Weekend. Remember, to grow as a software developer you need to invest in your future - one weekend at a time!"

Course Requirements:

 - To complete all of the in-class exercises, participants will need either an Intel-based Mac laptop (MacBook Air or MacBook Pro) or a Windows laptop and a MacinCloud account
 - Attendees should have some background in a procedural programming language (JavaScript, C, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Python) and some familiarity with concepts like variables, program flow control (loops, conditionals), and functions

Pricing/Availability:
Registration in the course is $700, with an early-bird discount price of $600 until March 11, 2013. The course runs from March 22nd until March 24th, and registration includes morning and afternoon coffee/snack breaks.
