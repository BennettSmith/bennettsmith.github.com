For the [iOS Weekend Beginner's Course](http://www.iosweekend.com) I'm teaching in Fremont in March we are planning to walk students through the
process of building an application called _Count'em UP_.  Over the past few weeks I have been working with the 
designer on the user interface.  I thought it would be fun to share the progression thus far.

# Rough Requirements Document

First I wrote up a short document that outlined what the application would do.  Here is a link to that document.

# Wireframes

A week or so of back-and-forth discussions with the designer and he shared these wireframes with me.
