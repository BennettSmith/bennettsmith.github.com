Really simple example of a code block.

```
$ sudo make me a sandwich
```

Something a little more interesting.

``` ruby Discover if a number is prime http://www.noulakaz.net/weblog/2007/03/18/a-regular-expression-to-check-for-prime-numbers/ Source Article
class Fixnum
    def prime?
        ('1' * self) 1~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
    end
end
```
