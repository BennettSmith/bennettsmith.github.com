A big ***Thank You*** goes out to the folks over at [Parallels][1]. 

For years I have been developing Windows applications on my MacBook Pro. When other developers ask me why my response is usually something like “The best windows development system I have is my MacBook Pro.” It is fast, the hardware build quality is excellent and best of all, with Parallels Desktop I can have the best of both worlds.

This weekend I saw a tweet from the folks over at Parallels that was part of their [promotion][2] to get people to upgrade to Windows 7. It was a contest to win a copy of Windows 7. Guess what – yup, I won! Check it out over on the [Parallels Consumer Tech Blog][3]. 

Don’t forget to send your own tweet to [@ParallelsMac][4] to enter.
