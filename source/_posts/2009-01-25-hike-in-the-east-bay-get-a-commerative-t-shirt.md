EBRPD is celebrating its 75th Anniversary and has partnered with Kaiser Permanente and the Regional Parks Foundation to make the Trails Challenge program free* for everyone (while supplies last). In an effort to go “green,” this year’s program will be hosted completely online. Register to receive the 2009 guidebook filled with 20 of the best hikes in the Regional Parks, an organic T-shirt, and commemorative pin for those who complete the challenge.

[Sign up][1] and [Get Out There][2]. See you on the trails!
