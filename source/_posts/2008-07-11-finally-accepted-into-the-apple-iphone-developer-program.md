The subject of this post says it all. I just received an e-mail from Apple indicating that I have been accepted into the Apple iPhone Developer Program and that I need to fill out some information to complete the registration process. I sure hope everything goes smoothly. I, like many developers, have been waiting to try my application on the iPhone for months.
