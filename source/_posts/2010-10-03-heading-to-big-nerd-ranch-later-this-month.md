One of the podcasts I listen to on a regular basis is called MacBreak. The hosts are Leo Leporte, Alex Lindsay, Andy Ihnatko and a rotating list of other Mac/Apple/iOS luminaries. If you aren’t familiar with it head over to <http://twit.tv/mbw> and have a listen. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in *all things Macintosh (and iOS too)*.

A few episodes ago Alex Lindsay mentioned that his company was going to be hosting a one week *Commuter iOS Class* at their San Francisco offices so their team could come up to speed developing applications for iOS devices. The class would be taught by the folks from [Big Nerd Ranch][1]. Usually the BNR folks teach classes from their *monastery* at a secret location just outside Atlanta, Georgia. Having them venture out to San Francisco; wow, what an opportunity. Oh, did I mention that Alex Lindsay also announced that there were a limited number of spots open to *the unwashed masses* to attend and the class would be held from 2:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. each day so folks could continue to do at least part of their day jobs.

All in all this just sounded too good to pass up so I fired off an e-mail to the folks at BNR to let them know I wanted to attend. My fingers were crossed because I know how quickly their classes fill up. Needless to say I wouldn’t be writing this post if I didn’t get in. <img src='http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

So, I’m off to the [Pixel Corps][2] offices later this month to soak up some more iOS goodness. Hope to see a few of you there too.

BTW: Here is a link to the [course description][3] for anyone curious.
