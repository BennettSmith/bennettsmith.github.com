My 27″ iMac has been having some very strange bluetooth problems lately. As mentioned in a recent blog post, all bluetooth devices were *unavailable* according to the operating system. Reboots didn’t fix the problem. Checking through the console logs turned up messages about the bluetooth drivers not working properly. Fortunately I had a USB keyboard so I was able to make a full backup of the system before scheduling an appointment with the genius at the Apple Store.

Now it has been a couple weeks and I have the machine back and Apple didn’t find anything wrong. In fact, they say the bluetooth works fine. I turned everything on and it works fine here too. I had a hunch that this might be the case. Last week my 13″ MBP had the exact same issue. No bluetooth devices would work with it. In this case a full reboot did correct the problem. 

So, what bluetooth devices do I have, and which one is misbehaving and causing all of these problems? I don’t know for sure, but I suspect either the new iPhone 4 or the Plantronics Bluetooth Headset I have. The Apple Bluetooth Keyboard and Magic Mouse seem to be working fine. I have noticed other issues with the bluetooth on the iPhone 4 when it syncs with the Alpine IWA-505 head unit in my truck so my money is on the iPhone 4 being the cause in all of these bluetooth problems. Time will tell.
