I'm a Software Architect working in the San Francisco Bay Area.  My passions are building and shipping high-quality software products, building agile software development teams, managing product deliverables, establishing and championing effective engineering practices, and motivating teams to exceed objectives while growing individual skills.

I have held various positions in startups, large enterprise software companies and a number of companies in the semiconductor industry.  In the past I have taught courses for University of California, Santa Cruz in their Extension program, focusing on Windows programming and XML/XSLT topics. If you are really curious about my professional life, please feel free to take a look at my <a href="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/bsmith-resume-for-web-updated-07-03-2008.pdf" title='Resume'>resume</a>.

I am experienced at developing GUI, Client/Server and Distributed applications on Windows, Mac, Linux and various embedded platforms. Fluent in C/C++, C# and Objective-C programming languages.Knowledge of Python, Perl, JavaScript and PHP scripting languages. Frameworks used include MFC, ATL, Cocoa, Qt, QtopiaCore, Boost and STL.

These days the software engineering topics I'm most interest in are Agile software engineering practices, Framework development, Software systems architecture, Rapid technology adoption and Cross-platform development.

Outside work my time is mostly spent chasing our son around, going on hikes, mountain biking, visiting with family or working in the yard.

``` c++ Unlock the key to my e-mail address. 
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    std::string fname = "bennett";
    std::string lname = "smith";
    std::string domain = "idevelopsoftware.com";

    std::cout << fname << lname << "@" << domain;

    return 0;
}
```
