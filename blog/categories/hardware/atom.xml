    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I finally got fed up with the frequent momentary disconnects that I was experiencing with Comcast. The cable modem/gateway device I have is a Motorola SURFboard SBG6580. I purchased this modem from Amazon after researching which models were supported by Comcast using the information on <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/">this page</a>. Device details are available <a href="http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/device.php?tier=-1&amp;devid=268&amp;e=0&amp;d3=1&amp;s=&amp;so=&amp;sc=228">here</a>. It is important to note that this is a currently supported option for connecting to the Comcast network.</p>

<p>Here is some information about the modem, as reported by accessing the web interface to the modem.</p>

<pre>Standard Specification Compliant   DOCSIS 3.0
Hardware Version    1
Software Version    <b>SBG6580-3.1.0.0-GA-07-180-NOSH</b>
Cable Modem MAC Address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
Cable Modem Serial Number   324369118008466559530006
CM certificate  Installed
</pre>


<p>Looking in the logs of my gateway device I noticed a number of critical error messages. Below is an excerpt of the logs currently on my device. One of the errors that comes up repeatedly is a <em>T3 time-out</em>. If you run google searches on this you will learn that many Comcast subscribers (and other cable providers too) see this error in conjunction with intermittent disconnects from their service.</p>

<p>I have reproduced the log of errors from the modem at the bottom of this post.</p>

<p>After a lot of reading of forum posts on <a href="http://forums.comcast.com">http://forums.comcast.com</a> I have learned that many people have similar issues.</p>

</ul>


<p>What all of these have in common is that after repeated suggestions from Comcast that it was a modem issue or an in-house wiring issue, and after customers in some cases spent money to swap out hardware, none of that helped to resolve the issue. The issue is most likely something <em>upstream</em> of the house, but other possibilities exist too.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that the firmware on this model is very old (and riddled with bugs) and that Motorola has made a number of updates to the firmware. You can read an interesting thread about trying to get the firmware upgraded <a href="http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Connectivity-and-Modem-Help/SBG6580-How-to-get-firmware-upgrade/td-p/976719">here</a>.</p>

<p>I found references to the following firmware versions being available from Motorola to the carriers.</p>

<ul>
<li>SBG6580-3.2.1.0-GA-02-249-NOSH</li>
<li>SBG6580-3.3.0.0-GA-06-022-NOSH</li>
</ul>


<p>Every networking device except a basic switch or hub has firmware in it that can be field upgraded. Most knowledgable customers are aware of this and have probably done at least one firmware upgrade of a networking device. The Motorola SURFboard 6580 is no different. The firmware can be upgraded. The problem is, Motorola will not provide the firmware to end consumers. <a href="http://broadband.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/17811">Here</a> is a support document from Motorola about their cable modems and the policies about firmware upgrades. To quote,</p>

<blockquote><p>We apologize about the inconvenience, but your Motorola modem does not support manual upgrades. Motorola is not allowed to control the upgrades of DOCSIS devices, per the standards specification. Any firmware or software changes must be implemented via the cable network. Your cable provider can update the firmware based on what they have approved for their network distribution. Because of that Motorola is not capable of installing firmware for cable modems. Please contact the cable operator to obtain information on upgrading firmware on the cable modem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Repeated calls to Comcast Customer Service (1-800-XFINITY / 1-800-934-6489) got me no where. I spent approximately two hours on the phone with them. I was disconnected three times, had it suggested to me that the problem was the modem multiple times and was offered the option of paying them for <em>Signature Support</em>, but at no time were they able to actually provide me with updated firmware for the modem.</p>

<ul>
<li>They were able to remotely reset the modem.</li>
<li>They studied the connection history and noted that indeed the line had been failing intermittently.</li>
<li>They were not at all interested in the content of the log messages I shared below.</li>
<li>They could not offer any explanation for the log messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>In summary, they were no help what so ever.</p>

<p>After reading about lack of firmware upgrades and my experience with their customer service folks I began to question whether <t>Comcast Cares(™)</i> about subscribers at all.</p>

<p>I wonder how many Comcast subscribers have similar problems with intermittent connection loss and just live with it. A survey of forum posts on their own site seems to indicate that the issues are wide spread.</p>

<p>This is truly a terrible situation. Customers purchase devices that Comcast recommends and then when something goes wrong with the service they place all of the blame on the in-house equipment and offer no support what so ever. The cable service providers have things structured such that consumers cannot get support for the devices from the manufacturers because that is the “service agreement” between the manufacturers and cable providers. Customers get squeezed in the middle without any recourse.</p>

<p>According to another site there are <a href="http://www.teltub.com/forum/index.php?topic=45.0">known problems</a> with the Motorola SURFboard, especially with VOIP. I suspect these problems could be addressed with a firmware update, but we have already established that Comcast is in no mood to provide the necessary updates.</p>

<p>As a last-ditch effort I am now going to place the SURFboard SBG6580 into bridge mode and use a separate router. I found instructions for doing this on Anthony Volodkin’s blog, <a href="http://fascinated.fm/post/2379188731/getting-a-motorola-sbg6580-into-bridge-mode-on">here</a>. I will use my Apple AirPort Extreme (which Apple happily provides firmware updates for) as my router.</p>

<p>In a few days/weeks I will post a follow-up to let people know if this <em>solved</em> the intermittent connection loss problems.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2011/08/capturing-airport-extreme-log-with-lion-server-syslog/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-09T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2011/08/capturing-airport-extreme-log-with-lion-server-syslog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mac OS X Lion Server can be used as a syslog server to capture the log messages from an Apple AirPort Extreme wireless router. The instructions below walk you through setting this up.</p>

<p>Syslog is controlled by a plist file found in the launch daemons directory. The full path to the file is:</p>

<pre>/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
</pre>


<p>You need to edit this file to add a network listener. The plist is stored in a binary format so you need to use the plutil to convert it to XML using this command:</p>

<pre>$ pushd /System/Library/LaunchDaemons
$ sudo plutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo vim /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo plutil -convert binary1 /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
$ sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist
</pre>


<p>Here is a complete example of the modified plist file. The new key is the NetworkListener. Be sure you add it nested inside the Sockets key or it will not work.</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1134216.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&quot;&gt;

	&lt;dict&gt;
		&lt;key&gt;NetworkListener&lt;/key&gt;
		&lt;dict&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockServiceName&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;string&gt;syslog&lt;/string&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockType&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;string&gt;dgram&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;/dict&gt;
		&lt;key&gt;AppleSystemLogger&lt;/key&gt;
		&lt;dict&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockPathMode&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;integer&gt;438&lt;/integer&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockPathName&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;string&gt;/var/run/asl_input&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;/dict&gt;
		&lt;key&gt;BSDSystemLogger&lt;/key&gt;
		&lt;dict&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockPathMode&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;integer&gt;438&lt;/integer&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockPathName&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;string&gt;/var/run/syslog&lt;/string&gt;
			&lt;key&gt;SockType&lt;/key&gt;
			&lt;string&gt;dgram&lt;/string&gt;
		&lt;/dict&gt;
	&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Once you have updated the plist the next step is to update the configuration of your AirPort Extreme. Under Applications => Utilities open the AirPort Utility and connect to your AirPort Extreme. On the Advanced tab select the “Logging &amp; Statistics” panel. Enter the IP address of your Mac OS X Lion Server in “Syslog Destination Address:” and select “6 – Informational” for the “Syslog Level:”. You can see a screenshot of the AirPort Utility settings below. Update the settings on the AirPort Extreme.</p>

<div>
  <img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-09083214-AirPort-Utility-Focal-Shift-AirPort-Extreme.png" alt="AirPort Extreme Advanced Configuration" title="[2011-08-09083214]  AirPort Utility-Focal Shift AirPort Extreme.png" border="0" width="320" height="318" />
</div>


<p>Now, you probably want to verify that the logging is actually happening. Open Console.app on your server and look at “All Messages”. While looking at the logs go to another machine (I used my MacBook Air with a wireless connection to the AirPort Extreme) and open System Preferences and then Network. Select your network adapter and ask for it to renew the DHCP lease. You should see some activity in the log.</p>

<p>Another way to verify the logging is to turn wifi off on your laptop. You should see a message like this:</p>

<pre>8/9/11 8:43:09.000 AM 80211: Disassociated with station 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0
</pre>


<p>When you turn wifi back on you will see something similar to this:</p>

<pre>8/9/11 8:43:10.000 AM 80211: Rotated TKIP group key.
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM 80211: Associated with station 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM 80211: Authenticating station 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0 to RADIUS.
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM 80211: Installed unicast CCMP key for supplicant 60:33:4b:2c:de:c0
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM natpmp: Binding added for udp, 173.164.164.17:32770 to 10.0.1.104:4500 with lifetime 7200
8/9/11 8:43:21.000 AM natpmp: Binding added for udp, 173.164.164.17:32771 to 10.0.1.104:5353 with lifetime 7200
</pre>


<p>That’s it. You now have syslog data being captured on your Mac OS X Lion server from your AirPort Extreme base station!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/08/imac-bluetooth-problems-gone-but-how/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-01T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/08/imac-bluetooth-problems-gone-but-how</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My 27″ iMac has been having some very strange bluetooth problems lately. As mentioned in a recent blog post, all bluetooth devices were <em>unavailable</em> according to the operating system. Reboots didn’t fix the problem. Checking through the console logs turned up messages about the bluetooth drivers not working properly. Fortunately I had a USB keyboard so I was able to make a full backup of the system before scheduling an appointment with the genius at the Apple Store.</p>

<p>Now it has been a couple weeks and I have the machine back and Apple didn’t find anything wrong. In fact, they say the bluetooth works fine. I turned everything on and it works fine here too. I had a hunch that this might be the case. Last week my 13″ MBP had the exact same issue. No bluetooth devices would work with it. In this case a full reboot did correct the problem.</p>

<p>So, what bluetooth devices do I have, and which one is misbehaving and causing all of these problems? I don’t know for sure, but I suspect either the new iPhone 4 or the Plantronics Bluetooth Headset I have. The Apple Bluetooth Keyboard and Magic Mouse seem to be working fine. I have noticed other issues with the bluetooth on the iPhone 4 when it syncs with the Alpine IWA-505 head unit in my truck so my money is on the iPhone 4 being the cause in all of these bluetooth problems. Time will tell.</p>

    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/07/wireless-keyboards-and-mice-are-great-until</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I sat down at my 27″ iMac to get a little work done. The first thing I do is tap the keyboard and move the mouse to wake the machine from sleep mode. The machine awoke and then quickly displayed the <em>Connection Lost</em> graphics in the middle of the screen for both the mouse and keyboard. My first thought; no problem, it’s just the batteries so I replaced them. Still no connection (and it did seem kind of odd for both the mouse and keyboard batteries to be dead at the same time.) Looking up at the system tray I see an odd Bluetooth icon. Here’s a closeup of what I found:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/LittleSnapper.png" alt="LittleSnapper.png" border="0" width="280" height="69" align="center" />
</div>


<p>The <em>Bluetooth: Not Available</em> message in the system tray is not a good sign. Next I opened up <em>Console.app</em> to see if there were any indications of what the root cause for this behavior was. It appears there is truly something wrong with the Bluetooth Module. Here is what it showed:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Console2.png" alt="[AppleUSBBluetoothHCIController][FindInterfaces] some interface pipes were not found. Device is no good a a transport" border="0" width="730" height="124" align="center" />
</div>


<p>A visit to the support forums at Apple led me to an idea to reset the SMC on the iMac. I tried that and still nothing. At this point I’m not a happy camper. It is looking like the Bluetooth Module in my iMac has given up the ghost.</p>

<p>Next step, the iPhone Apple AppStore application to make a Genius Bar appointment.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/genius.png" alt="genius.png" border="0" width="213" height="320" align="center" />
</div>


<p>If you have read this far then you might be wondering why I’m telling you all of this. The reason is simple. Without a USB keyboard and mouse laying around somewhere none of the troubleshooting above would have been possible. Having a wireless bluetooth keyboard and mouse ship by default with the iMac is a really odd choice on Apple’s part.</p>

<p>Thankfully I have a keyboard and mouse from the Xserve in my garage. In case you forgot what these old fashion beasts look like, here’s a picture of the dynamic duo that saved my bacon tonight!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/04/ipad-review-first-24-hours/"/>
    <updated>2010-04-05T08:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.idevelopsoftware.com/2010/04/ipad-review-first-24-hours</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My experience with it so far is mixed. Like you I tried to touch-type on the keyboard and that really didn’t work at all. I have tried to do the two finger plus thumbs approach and am not that fast typing like that. The keyboard is big enough that I find it kind of weird to hold it in one hand and type with the other. My hand has to move too far to get all the keys unlike on the iPhone where everything is much closer together. I have not tried to hook up a bluetooth keyboard yet either. I expect that to work much better for things like typing e-mails.</p>

<p>I ended up purchasing the 64GB version instead of the 16GB version. The change was based on a recommendation I heard on MacBreak Weekly. They mentioned that based on their preview use (had it for about a week before April 3rd) they feel that if you are going to use it to read books then you will easily fill the 16GB and then have to pick/choose which items to sync to your iPad. With the 64GB version you can just dump all the books/PDFs you want on it and not worry about running out of space.</p>

<p>I have the Kindle for iPad application on it and pulled down all my Kindle books. Very cool! It just works! I also downloaded the iBooks application from the App Store. That application reads the ePub format. I have purchased a number of technical books in the past few years from Pragmatic Programmers. All of their books are available in ePub format so I downloaded that version and loaded them into the iPad too.</p>

<p>So far I really like having all of my technical books in one place like this. I have not tried reading out in full sunlight, but expect it will be an issue. For reading indoors it works fine. Not as easy on the eyes as the Kindle, but it shows all of the technical illustrations in the books in full color which is much better.</p>

<p>I purchased the Pages, Numbers and Keynote applications from Apple also. They really show off the sort of things you can accomplish with the iPad, but the crash a lot. I feel more like a beta tester of these apps than just a user. Sort of a let down, but then I have been here before with other Apple products. Eventually these will be great applications.</p>

<p>With the iPad I also purchased the Apple case for the iPad. I was really surprised when I opened it up at home. The quality of the case is really bad. It only cost $39, but it sucks compared to the case that Amazon sells for the Kindle. After about 2 hours of using the iPad in the case I got so annoyed with it that now I am using the iPad without a case. I am shopping for a different case now.</p>

<p>I have had Safari crash on me more than once now on the iPad. It seems like the crashes were always on very long (lots of scrolling) web pages so maybe it is a memory issue. I’m not sure, but the end result is you are just reading along on the page and all of a sudden you are back to the menu of icons wondering how you got there.</p>

<p>Even more surprising than the crashes of apps on the device is the crash I experienced this morning of the Xcode development environment on the desktop. Apple released an update to Xcode that includes all of the iPad development tools yesterday. I was working on a sample application this morning, following the instructions on how to build an app when all of a sudden Xcode just up and crashed on me. This is very unusual. Earlier versions of Xcode have been very stable for years.</p>

<p>Over all I think purchasing one as a developer at this point is a good move, but for basic consumers it is probably more sensible to wait about 3 months before jumping on the iPad bandwagon.</p>
