  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first computer I owned was an Atari 800. While this was not the first machine I worked on (in 7th grade I was using a TRS-80 from Radio Shack to program in Basic and was using an Apple // at a neighbor’s house to play Space Invaders), it was the first machine I had at home every day after school and all summer long!</p>

<p>Here is a photo of what this beast looked like. I had the main unit with keyboard, a couple language cartridges and two of the Atari 810 floppy disk drive units. I didn’t have the printer shown in the picture. <a href="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/atari800-810-820.jpg"><img src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/atari800-810-820.jpg?w=128" alt="Atari 800, 810 and 820." width="128" height="66" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-64" /></a> In order to program this computer I used the BASIC Programming Language. This was loaded into the computer by inserting a ROM cartridge.</p>

<p>The concept of a disk operating system was somewhat limited in those days. If you wanted to move files around on the floppy disks you didn’t have many options. Of course, this meant there was a golden opportunity for someone to create an application to address this shortcoming!</p>

<p>Shareware was all the rage back then so a friend and I set out to build an application that would help with disk management. Of course, back in those days there was no Internet, no concept of registering your domain name, or any notion of taking payments via PayPal. Nope, in those days you had modems and buliten board systems. People ran file BBS nodes using something called FidoNet. Some people had more than one dial-in phone line for their BBS systems. Most only had one phone line, and some had to shut down their BBS systems when they wanted to make phone calls.</p>

<p>Our plan was to build the application and upload it to FidoNet. People would get to use it for free, and if they liked it they would mail us a check for a few dollars. (Yes — using the postal service, a stamp, and a real paper check.) The application was called Disk Master and the company we founded was called Seaview Software.</p>

<p>I don’t have a copy of the software anylonger but did run across a copy of the <a href="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/disk-master-10-seaview-software.pdf">documentation</a> for our first release.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently a friend and I started talking about possibly doing some technology podcasts. Our general concept is to have a podcast that talks about how developers keep current with the never ending sea of new technologies, languages and developer kits (SDKs). It is both daunting and exciting to always be learning new technologies. The structure of a weekly or bi-weekly podcast that dives into a new technology or concept each time will give us a means for exploring new things that interest us, and might also be useful to other developers.</p>

<p>Well, if we are going to do a podcast we need gear. I didn’t have anything at all, but my friend already had a good microphone and preamp from other audio work he does. I spent a few weeks educating myself about the various alternatives and finally settled on the following setup to get started.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sennheiser HD280 Professional headphones for monitoring the audio.</li>
<li>Edirol UA-25 USB audio capture and MIDI interface.</li>
<li>Rode NT1-A Studio/Live Performance Condenser Microphone.</li>
<li>Atlas Sound DS7E desktop mic stand.</li>
<li>Shure Studio Mic Pop Filter.</li>
<li>ProCo StageMASTER 10′ mic/audio cable, XLR.</li>
</ul>


<p>I ordered everything from the folks at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bswusa.com">BSW</a> since they sponsored the <a target="_blank" href="http://gearmediatech.libsyn.com">Gear Media Tech</a> podcast which was very helpful as I figured out what to purchase. Here are a couple pictures of the initial setup.</p>

<p>As you can see in the first picture, the Rode NT1-A fits nicely in the Atlas desktop mic stand. The Shure pop filter attached to the mic stand at the base and was easily positioned in front of the mic. The only issue I have noticed with this setup so far is that unless the pop filter bracket is swung to the side it causes the whole stand to tip forward a bit due to the weight of the mic and pop filter. With a little adjusting I found a position for the pop filter that seemed to keep the weight distribution in check.</p>

<p><a href="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/microphone-large.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/microphone1.png" alt="Microphone.png" border="0" width="150" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>I had considered a more professional desktop swing-arm mic stand, but figured that I would only be recording about once a week. I didn’t really like the idea of having that swing-arm attached to my desk all the time. It just seemed like that would become a distraction. The desktop mic stand is very portable and I think that will make it easy to move it out of the way when not in use. My friend went the other route, getting a desktop swing-arm, in part because he has a limited amount of desktop space.</p>

<p>It only took about 15 minutes from the time I opened the BSW box of goodies until I had the whole setup running with me MacBook Pro. The Edirol UA-25 was recognized by the MacBook Pro right away. Here is a picture of the whole setup.</p>

<p><a href="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/podcastingrig-large.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/podcastingrig1.png" alt="PodcastingRig.png" border="0" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>The desk is kind of messy right now. I will be experimenting over the next few days with how to better organize all of the pieces. My MacBook Pro is held up off the desk by a Ergotron laptop swing-arm, and is also hooked to a 24″ Samsung SyncMaster 245BW monitor. One issue I have right now with the arrangement of the equipment is that the mic gets in the way of the lower half of the 245BW. Since I expect to be recording some podcast screen casts using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.varasoftware.com/products/screenflow/">ScreenFlow</a> I really want to workout a placement for the equipment that doesn’t get in the way of using the screen, but still keeps the microphone positioned for good sound pickup. Once I figure out a setup that works for me I will post an update here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The following was seen recently, buried in the responsibilities list of an employment advertisement seeking a skilled Director of Software Engineering to lead a small team developing a new software product.</p>

<blockquote><p>Make time for continuous re-factoring and improving existing code and unit tests, to keep the codebase clean, maintainable and fun to work on</p></blockquote>

<p>What makes this so interesting to me is that there aren’t more senior level software engineering positions requiring this sort of investment in the organizations’ future. I really wish more companies would recognize that it is very important to aggressively carve out some fraction of the engineering time in each release and allocate it to re-factoring and improving existing code.</p>

<p>Every place I work it seems like I end up being the sole voice for continuous improvement and refinement within the existing code. It always feels like I’m trying to sell snow removal equipment in the Middle East, or that I’m pushing 10 times my weight up a steep incline.</p>

<p>Anyone who has spent time in <em>Startup Land</em> <sup>tm</sup> will be familiar with the oft-heard refrain “There isn’t time to do it right, just make it work.” This is destructive on so many levels; to the product, to the team, to the company, to share holder value, etc.</p>

<p>The current mind set is basically to pour as many new features as possible in each subsequent product release and to fix some percentage of the bugs that exist in the system. When architectural deficiencies surface within the code-base management will often choose to defer addressing the issue (i.e., The issue is shelved indefinitely.)</p>

<p>In essence this behavior is a race to the bottom, both for the development team and the product. As more features are added and more work-arounds are implemented to fix bugs the software becomes more and more brittle. This cycle continues until it is impossible to re-factor at all. The inevitable result is a full rewrite of the software or the death of the product as the company can no longer keep pace with newer competitors that are not constrained by this legacy.</p>

<p>I once heard Grady Booch [<a href="http://www.booch.com/architecture/blog.jsp">Blog</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch">Wikipedia</a>], co-inventor of UML, speaking at a conference about the state of our industry. He used the analogy of building dog houses vs. sky scrapers to make a similar point. His position was that without time spent on architecture, object-oriented design and continuous re-factoring it was impossible to build anything as complex as a sky scraper. He recognized that many teams have a grand vision for their software, but unless they embrace software architecture as a discipline they will never be able to stack up multiple dog houses to create a sky scraper. It just isn’t possible. I encourage you to read through his <a href="http://www.booch.com/architecture/blog/artifacts/Software%20Architecture.ppt">PowerPoint presentation</a> on the topic or view a PDF <a href="http://visitconsulting.net/UML.PDF">here</a>.</p>

<p>A significant change in the mindset of software managers is needed in our industry. The lifespan of most successful large-scale software systems is at least 5 years, and many systems are in productive use for decades. To remain agile and responsive as a company the code-base must be re-factored, improved and refined at every step along the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend most of my time developing software in C/C++, and have done so for many years now. One thing that always catches me by surprise is when I find code written by someone who decides to put implementation details of a function or method in a header file. The only reason I can come up with for why developers would do this is pure laziness.</p>

<blockquote><p>Let’s face it, C and C++ are such a pain in the but. I mean, each ADT or Class needs two files; a .h and .c/.cpp. It sure would be easier to just lump all the stuff in a single file. Well, since C/C++ can’t generally handle that we might as well sprinkle some of the code into the .h file and some of it into the .cpp file. The compiler really doesn’t care where the code is. And, to top it off, switching between files in most editors takes at least one keystroke. Whoooaaa – what a burden for a busy developer. <img src='http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, this has been written about by numerous people on the web as well as having been covered by many technical journals and books. The concept is to keep the interface in one file and the implementation in another. I am still amazed to find that people routinely place implemenation details in the header files of C++ classes. All this does is <strong>slow down compile times</strong>. Some might say “So what, it doesn’t really matter anyhow. The program still compiles.” Well I say life is too short to spend all your time waiting for the compiler to recompile code that it already compiled, and for which there is no actualy reason to recompile at this point.</p>

<p>It all comes down to dependency management. Developers need to understand how the pieces of their programs interact, how that interaction impacts the build speed for the application, and be aware of techniques they can use to minimize the dependencies between components in their applications.</p>

<p>So, why is it such a bad idea to put implementation details into a header file? There are a number of design principles that would suggest separating interface from implementation pays dividens over the lifetime of an application.</p>

<p>When implementation details creep into an interface header everyone suffers. The compiler has to recompile many more modules each time an implementation change is made. Usually these recompiles are completely unnecessary since all the other modules require is the interface definition from the header file. The problem is that the compiler cannot distinguish an interface change from an implementation change when all of the code is packed into a single header file.</p>

<p>By keeping interface and implementation seperate compile speed will improve. On all but the most trivial projects this is an important thing to keep in mind.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At some point in the life-cycle of a product being developed it seems like every team ends up trying to decide if they should ship debug symbols with their product. On one side of the discussion are people who perceive that the crown jewels of the company are somehow at risk if the symbols escape from their office. On the other side of the discussion are people who perceive that having matching debug symbols delivered with the shipping product will help with solving the inevitable problems that arise in the field.</p>

<p>So, who is correct here? How much of a risk is there in shipping debug symbols?</p>

<p>My own opinion is that shipping the debug symbols for a release build of a product presents a very small degree of risk. I feel that anyone so inclined can reverse-engineer your product from the shipping executable files, and not having symbol information will not deter them. It may slow them down slightly, but not by a sufficient amount to warrant not shipping symbols.</p>

<p>Since this topic comes up so frequently I figured I would try and collect together various other points of view on the question. First stop; Google!</p>

<p>The quote below is from the project page of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crashrpt/">CrashRpt</a> library, found on the Google Code service.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ve received several comments/inquiries about shipping debug builds or debug symbols. You should never ship debug builds or debug symbols as they will not only take up more space on your CD/download/client’s workstation, but they will also make reverse engineering your code a trivial exercise. To be clear, what I’m suggesting is modify your release build configuration so that it generates debug symbols, saving both the release builds of your modules and their corresponding debug symbols in your source control system and delivering only the release builds of your modules to clients (as you do today). When a crash report comes in, you use the release build and debug symbols you archived, along with the minidump included in the crash report, to debug the crash.</p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft had published a technical article titled <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260783(VS.60).aspx">Generating and Deploying Debug Symbols with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0</a> that goes through some of the options when consdiering if shipping debug symbols is appropriate for your product. From the article …</p>

<blockquote><p>The first thing you have to do is determine whether you should deploy your debug symbols. In general, you should deploy symbols during most of your internal testing. This will give you better information to track down bugs. But before you deploy debug symbols to your customers, you should consider whether you want them to have access to that level of information about your application and whether they have the extra storage space. You also need to consider the type of customer you are targeting. Many software developers like to have debug symbols. Many end users would rather not use up their hard drive space for something they are unlikely to use.</p>

<p>For instance, Windows NT deploys debug symbols with the operating system. These symbols contain primarily function-level symbols and FPO records. Microsoft Office does not deploy debug symbols.</p></blockquote>

<p>And then later in the same article…</p>

<blockquote><p>Deploying debug symbols does not affect the performance or initialization of your application, but does impact available hard drive space. Debug symbols can take up some significant hard drive space, depending on the granularity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another terrific article I came across is <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/journals/1412">Release Mode Debugging</a>, published by ACCU in their <strong>Overload Journal</strong>. I would recommend reading the entire article to gain some perspective on the idea of having a single build for your product instead of separate debug and release builds.</p>

<p>The argument against shipping debug symbols is often that this will make it easier for competitors to gain access to the intellectual property that you hold so dear. While it is true that having the debug symbols (especially for internal private structures) will make the process of reverse engineering your software easier, it by no means prevents it. The application <a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/">IDA Pro</a> is a commercial disassembler and debugger that would make reverse engineering of any application possible. They call it <em>The most advanced tool for Hostile Code Analysis, Vulnerability Research and Software Reverse Engineering</em>.</p>

<p>Further evidence that a lack of debug symbols is no protection against reverse engineering comes from the article <a href="">Reverse Engineering Hostile Code</a>, published on the SecurityFocus web site. Anyone who believes that hackers are thwarted from decompiling or reverse engineering your software because they don’t have symbol information will surely change their point of view after reading this article.</p>

<p>In the end, it seems like shipping debug symbols or not is more a “feel good” issue for an organization than it is a way to actually address a security concern.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span class="alignright"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.trolltech.com"><img src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/qt.png" alt="qt.png" border="0" width="48" height="48" /></a></span>Today I wanted to combine two images of similar size to create a new image. The new image was going to be used for a toolbar button. I have purchased a set of commercial images in the PNG format for use on application toolbars. The set came with a bunch of overlay images that could be used to modify each of the base images. The overlays included things like arrows, warning signs, arrows, people, etc. My first though for using these images was to fire up Adobe Illustrator and just create a new icon by merging the base and overlay together. Then I realized that Qt could do the job for me at runtime, and with a little work I could dynamically overlay different badges on a base icon.</p>

<p>The code below can be used to construct a composite image. You pass in references to a base image and an overlay image. These images are used to construct a third image, and that is returned to the caller.</p>

<pre>QImage createImageWithOverlay(const QImage& baseImage, const QImage& overlayImage)
{
    QImage imageWithOverlay = QImage(baseImage.size(), QImage::Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied);
    QPainter painter(&imageWithOverlay);

    painter.setCompositionMode(QPainter::CompositionMode_Source);
    painter.fillRect(imageWithOverlay.rect(), Qt::transparent);

    painter.setCompositionMode(QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceOver);
    painter.drawImage(0, 0, baseImage);

    painter.setCompositionMode(QPainter::CompositionMode_SourceOver);
    painter.drawImage(0, 0, overlayImage);

    painter.end();

    return imageWithOverlay;
}
</pre>


<p></p></p>

<p>Here is an example of using this routine to create an image that might be used to represent something being transfered from a network attached machine.</p>

<pre>QImage baseImage(":/Resources/connect_pc_64.png");
    QImage overlayLogoff(":/Resources/overlay_arrow_east_64.png");
    QImage logoffImage = createImageWithOverlay(baseImage, overlayLogoff)
</pre>


<p>The two source images and resulting composite are shown below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One thing I am always nervous about is storing sensitive data on my MacBook Pro. Over the past few years it seems like there are stories popping up in the news about some organization loosing sensitive customer data when a laptop is misplaced. As someone who makes a conscious effort to have only one computer, I am concerned about storing my banking and tax information on a portable computer. <span class="alignleft"><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VKQ8VE?ie=UTF8&tag=idevelop-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000VKQ8VE"><img border="0" src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/41my62mkrll-sl160.jpg" /></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=idevelop-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000VKQ8VE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0 !important;" /><br /> </span></p>

<p>After searching for quite some time I finally settled on a solution that has been working very well for me. My criteria were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data must be encrypted.</li>
<li>Storage device must be removable.</li>
<li>Data access should only be permitted once a suitable password has been entered.</li>
<li>Password must be required to access data after MacBook Pro comes out of sleep mode.</ol>
To meet my goals I am using a piece of software called <a href="http://www.knoxformac.com">Knox</a> in conjunction with an ExpressCard/34 solid-state disk. I am currently using a Lexar ExpressCard/34 SSD with an 8GB capacity since that is what the local computer store had available at the time, about six months ago. Today it is possible to get a 32GB card from TRANSCEND, so the capacity is ever increasing! <span class="alignright"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.knoxformac.com/"><img class="alignright" src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/logotag.gif" alt="logotag.gif" border="0" width="300" height="57" /></a></span></li>
</ul>


<p>The card I store my sensitive data on is the Lexar 8GB ExpressCard SSD. It fits in the ExpressCard/34 slot on the left side of my MacBook Pro and is makes for a very convenient place to store all of my Quicken and TurboTax data files. Using Knox I setup the entire Lexar card as an encrypted filesystem.</p>
