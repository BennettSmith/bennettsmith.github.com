  <div class="entry-content"><p>In order to digitally sign Windows drivers you need what Microsoft called an Authenticode Digital Certificate. The company I work is creating a number of drivers, so we had a need for an Authenticode Digital Certificate. The certificate would also be used to sign the Microsoft installer packages that we release to customers.</p>

<p>Being a cost conscious group we shopped around and identified two main sources for Authenticode digital certificates.</p>

<ul>
<li>VeriSign http://www.verisign.com</li>
<li>Thawte http://www.thawte.com</li>
</ul>


<p>Comparing the prices it seemed clear that the Thawte certificate was a better bet so that is what we purchased. Everything appeared to be fine until we tried to join the WinQual program. That is when I started asking myself the following question:</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: When is an Authenticode Digital Certificate not an Authenticode Digital Certificate?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: When you try and use it in the application process for joining the WinQual program.</p>

<p>In the last couple weeks I have been learning about the requirements to digitally sign Windows device drivers. My strategy has been to take the Toaster sample from Microsoft and try to duplicate all of the steps necessary to build a signed version of the driver. Naively, I figured it should be easy to replicate the steps taken by Microsoft to sign this sample program. Boy was I wrong!</p>

<p>It turns out that there is a utility called inf2cat or something like that. Microsoft recommends using it to create the category file containing hashes of the files you want digitally signed as part of your driver package. So, for me to replicate the Toaster sample signing process I need a copy of inf2cat. This tool is apparently only available to members of the WinQual program that Microsoft runs.</p>

<p>Okay, so I need to join WinQual. How hard could that be. I went to https://winqual.microsoft.com and learned that in order to joint he program you must submit a file to them that is digitally signed with your Authenticode certificate. So off I went to get an Authenticode certificate for my company. After a few google searches I came to the conclusion that VeriSign and Thawte are the two primary sources for these certificates, and Thawte is considerably cheaper. I purchased an Authenticode certificate from Thawte and a few days later the certificate was on my machine and it was time to make the membership request on the WinQual site.</p>

<p>I followed all of the instructions to digitally sign the required file using my new Authenticode certificate. Everything seemed to go smoothly until I tried to upload the signed file to Microsoft. Their web site kept saying that the file was not signed correctly. I went back to the main WinQual web page to try and find an answer to this problem. There was nothing there to help me solve this mystery so I went to the only other resource I could think of. That is the DDK mailing list archives at OSR. These folks have been doing Windows driver work for ages and if anyone knew what was wrong, I was sure the answers would be on their mailing list.</p>

<p>It only took one keyword search of the archives to learn what the problem was. It seems that not all Authenticode digital certificates are created equal, and Microsoft has a predilection to those minted by VeriSign. My new Thawte digital certificate would be just fine for signing my drivers, but it would not be at all useful in joining the WinQual program. It was beginning to look like I needed to buy another Authenticode certificate from VeriSign in order to join the WinQual program.</p>

<p>After carefully re-reading the WinQual page describing the ways to join the program I learned that you could also sign your membership request using something called a Corporate Identifier. It was a cheaper, less capable digital certificate that could be used to sign the file and join the program. This certificate could be purchased from VeriSign for $99.</p>

<p>I waited another couple days and the new Corporate Identifier finally appeared in my inbox. I followed the instructions to sign the file, upload it, and this time I met with success in joining the WinQual program.</p>

<p>So, instead of saving money by using the Thawte certificate I ended up spending roughly the same amount of money that it would have cost to just purchase the Authenticode certificate from VeriSign. The difference was that because the WinQual site was not clear on the specific requirements for using a VeriSign certificate I ended up wasting at least 2 or 3 days trying to join the WinQual program.</p>

<p>In the end it was clear that I should have purchased the “name brand” digital certificate from VeriSign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you would like to capture a log of everything that GDB displays during a debugging session you can do the following:<br/>
<code>&lt;br /&gt;
$ defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXGDBDebuggerLogToFile YES&lt;br /&gt;
</code><br/>
The statement above will turn on logging to a file. Now, you need to set the filename for the debugger output file. Use the following statement to accomplish that.<br/>
<code>&lt;br /&gt;
$ defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXGDBDebuggerLogFileName /tmp/gdboutput.log&lt;br /&gt;
</code><br/>
This will create a file in the /tmp directory called gdboutput.log, containing everything you see in the GDB command window during your debugging session.</p>

<p>Both of these commands need to be typed into a Terminal.app window. You only need to do this once, as your machine will remember the settings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mac OS Tiger introduced a new daemon control application called launchd. This application is supposed to take the place of rc scripts, xinitd scripts, and cron jobs. The launchd process is configured using XML text files that conform to the Apple plist DTD. Perforce does not provide a sample launchd configuration file for the p4d daemon.</p>

<p>The following is an example of how I configured p4d to run on my Tiger server. Be sure to edit it appropriately for your server configuration.</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
                        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;GroupName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;perforce&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.perforce.p4d&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;OnDemand&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;false/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/p4d&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/p4d&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-r&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/Depot&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-p&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;1666&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-J&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/Depot/journal&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-L&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/Depot/p4err&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ServiceDescription&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;Perforce Daemon&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/Depot/p4d.stderr.txt&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/Depot/p4d.stdout.txt&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;p4admin&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/Depot&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</pre>


<p>I place this file in the directory /Library/LaunchDaemons, and is named perforce.plist. The permissions look like this:</p>

<pre>-rw-r-----    1 root  wheel   1012 Jan  5 22:21 perforce.plist
</pre>


<p>You will need to tell launchd about the new plist by running:</p>

<pre>$ sudo launchctl load perforce.plist
</pre>


<p>from the /Library/LaunchDaemons directory. To confirm that the new plist has been loaded correctly you can run this command:</p>

<pre>$ sudo launchctl list
</pre>


<p>The list produced should contain a line that says com.perforce.p4d. That is the name given to the new plist for the p4d application.<br/>
At this point you should see a p4d process if you run</p>

<pre>$ ps -aux
</pre>


<p>There should only be one of this process running, and it is the daemon controlling your Perforce server installation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. EXPECT UPDATES AND DON’T BE SURPRISED BY INCOMPLETE INFORMATION</em><span class="alignright"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.trolltech.com"><img src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/qt.png" alt="qtlogo_feature.png" border="0" /></a></span></p>

<p>Trolltech has released Qt 4 under a dual-license for all supported platforms. In earlier versions of Qt they only released the open source version for Mac and Linux, leaving Windows developers with no choice but to purchase a commercial license. That all changed with the release of Qt 4 when Trolltech started to provide an open source version for Windows development too! The only catch was that Trolltech only supports the MinGW GCC compiler for development using the open source version.</p>

<p>This article describes how to patch Qt 4 open source edition on Windows so you can develop using Visual Studio 2005. You can even develop using the free Express edition of Visual Studio 2005 so long as you also install the latest Platform SDK.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these patches and tips are not provided so you can get around the very generous Trolltech dual-license terms of use. If you are developing or intend to develop a commercial application using Qt 4 you must purchase a commercial license for Qt 4. Only use the information provided in this article if you wish to develop open source GPL software for the Windows platform and wish to use the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 compiler instead of the MinGW GCC compiler.</p>

<h2>Download Qt 4.1 Source Code, Patches, and Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Download the latest open source Windows version of Qt 4.1 from Trolltech at http://www.trolltech.com/download/qt/windows.html. Unzip the file to C:. It will extract all of the files into a sub-directory called qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0.</li>
<li>Download the latest patch file used to modify the open source version of Qt 4.1 to support Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 from Source Forge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtwin/. Unzip the file to C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0.</li>
<li>Download the build script, environment setup and notes from http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/downloads/qt/Qt41WinBuildScript.zip. Unzip the file to C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0.</li>
<li><p>If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2005 you can download the Express edition. You will also need to download the Platform SDK.

</ul>


<h2>Building Qt 4.1 using Visual C++ 2005</h2>

<p>Open C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0 in Windows Explorer.<br/>
Double-click on the “Qt 4.1 Command Prompt” shortcut to open a Command Prompt window with the environment setup for Qt 4.1 development. IMPORTANT: You must already have Visual Studio 2005 installed. You may need to edit setenv.cmd if your copy of Visual Studio 2005 is not in the default location.</p>

<p>Run “installpatch41.bat”<br/>
This will patch the Qt 4.1 source code so it builds properly using the Visual C++ 2005 compiler.</p>

<p>Run “build.cmd”<br/>
This will build all of the Qt 4.1 libraries, utilities, and sample applications using the Visual C++ 2005 compiler.</p>

<p>To rebuild, if necessary, make sure to first clean up the previous build. Do this by running<br/>
nmake distclean</p>

<p>from the C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0 directory.</p>

<p>External Tools Configuration in Visual Studio 2005</p>

Select the “Commands” tab on the “Customize” dialog. Select “Tools” from the “Categories:” list. Scroll down in the “Commands:” list until you see “External Command 7″. Drag commands 7, 8, 9, and 10 onto the new “Qt 4.1 Development” toolbar.<br/>
Creating a New Visual Studio 2005 Project</p>

<p>Open the “New Project” dialog by selecting File->New->Project… from the menu. Under “Project types” on the left side of the dialog expand “Visual C++” and then select “General.” The right side of the dialog will display a list of all the general project types. Select “Makefile Project” from the list of project types. Provide a name for the project and set the location on disk where you wish the project to be saved. Be sure not to check “Create directory for solution”, as this will create an extra level of directories that is just confusing. Click the “OK” button and you will be presented with the “Makefile Application Wizard.” Simply press the “Finish” button on the first page of the wizard.</p>

<p>Once the project has been created and opened, set the NMake Configuration Properties for the project as shown below. In the “Solution Explorer” right-click on the name of your project. Select “Properties…” from the context menu. On the property pages dialog select “Configuration Properties” and “NMake” on the left side tree control.

<p>Create a project file called “foo.pro” in the directory for your makefile project. Replace the name “foo.pro” with the name of your actual application. Place the file in the directory where your Visual Studio project was created. To start with, the contents might look something like this:</p>

<p>CONFIG += qt<br/>
TEMPLATE = app<br/>
SOURCES += foo.cpp<br/>
HEADERS += foo.h<br/>
FORMS += foo.ui<br/>
You should be off and running now. For more detailed information I would suggest reading the qmake reference manual. You might also want to take a look at the Qt 4.1 tutorials in Qt Assistant. Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A typical configuration of Perforce is handled by setting the P4PORT, P4USER and P4CLIENT environment variables. These variables point at the desired depot, identify the user and select a client workspace.</p>

<p>To quickly switch between different depots or client workspaces I make sure the P4CONFIG environment variable specifies the name of a configuration file. On my Windows XP system this is done by running the command p4 set P4CONFIG=p4config.txt. The p4 command will recognize that this variable is set and will attempt to locate a configuration file each time it is launched. The search begins in the current directory and searches all parent directories until it reaches the root directory for the current drive.</p>

<p>I place a p4config.txt file in each workspace root directory. The file is formatted as a series of lines where each line contains name=value. For example, one of my p4config.txt files looks like this:</p>

<p>P4CLIENT=bsmith_pc<br/>
P4EDITOR=C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\vim.exe<br/>
P4PORT=perforce.mysite.com:1666<br/>
P4USER=bsmith</p>

<p>My installation of Perforce is configured to use the ticket-based authentication system so I can login to the depot by issuing the p4 login command from a directory below the workspace root. I will be prompted for the password and a ticket will be issued. From this point on I can simply issue p4 commands and the appropriate depot and workspace will be automatically selected.</p>

<p>This technique can be applied to multiple client workspaces at the same time by setting up multiple p4config.txt files and logging into each depot. Then it is a simple matter of changing directories in my command window to switch between depots and/or client workspaces.</p>

<p>On Unix and Mac OS X I set P4CONFIG to point at a file called @.p4config@. The file contents are similar to the Windows example earlier in this post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Download the latest version of Perforce from their web site (http://www.perforce.com). To setup the server you really only need to download the command-line tools p4 and p4d. Here are links to the versions I used when setting up my server in January 2006.</p>

<p>http://www.perforce.com/downloads/perforce/r05.2/bin.macosx102ppc/p4</p>

<p>http://www.perforce.com/downloads/perforce/r05.2/bin.darwin60ppc/p4d</p>

<p>You may also wish to install the graphical tools P4V and P4Merge. These are part of a single disk image.</p>

<p>http://www.perforce.com/downloads/perforce/r05.2/bin.macosx102ppc/P4V.dmg</p>

<p>Perforce recommends that p4d not be run as root so I created a new user account called p4admin. I also created a new group called perforce. I decided to install the software in the /usr/local/bin directory and to place the depot on a separate drive that is mounted under the /Depot directory.</p>

<p>Automatically starting p4d when the system boots is handled through the utility launchd. Configuring this is done by editing a plist file and then loading it with the utility launchctl. Attached is a copy of the plist file I used. I placed the plist file in the directory /Library/LaunchDaemons. The file is called perforce.plist.</p>

<p>Once the file exists use the launchctl application to tell the launchd program about it. The command I used was:</p>

<p>$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/perforce.plist</p>

<p>If you make changes to the plist file and want to reload it use the command below to unload the existing one. Then repeat the above command to load the changed plist.</p>

<p>$ sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/perforce.plist</p>

<p>Perforce recommends setting up a regular job to create a checkpoint and a backup of the depot. The script p4backup illustrates how to handle this. Use the p4backup.plist file to teach launchd about this script so it will run on a regular basis. On my server I run this script every night. The backup is done using a copy from the /Depot directory to the /Depot.Backup directory, which is on a separate filesystem.</p>

<p>perforce.plist GroupName perforce Label com.perforce.p4d OnDemand Program /usr/local/bin/p4d ProgramArguments /usr/local/bin/p4d -r /Depot -p 1666 -J /Depot/journal -L /Depot/p4err RunAtLoad ServiceDescription Perforce Daemon StandardErrorPath /Depot/p4d.stderr.txt StandardOutPath /Depot/p4d.stdout.txt UserName p4admin WorkingDirectory /Depot</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Class: Introduction to Qt Programming<br/>
Instructor: Robert Hartley (rhartley@ics.com)</p>

<p>Send Robert an e-mail requesting a copy of the “C++<br/>
Programming for Qt” presentation.</p>

<p>Breakfast – Scientific Toolworks</p>

<p>Send e-mail asking for a copy of full week notes PDF file.</p>

<h1>Enhancement for Qt 4.1  </h1>

<p>Qt Designer 4.1 will have a menu editor and a toolbar<br/>
editor.</p>

<h1>Observation about QMake  </h1>

<p>People are confronting issues with their existing build<br/>
environments and how to integrate qmake into that. At least<br/>
one person indicated that he feels like it is necessary to<br/>
give up some of the nice things in qmake to use his build<br/>
system. Likewise, if he uses qmake then he gives up other<br/>
things that are relied upon as part of their environment.</p>

<h1>Possible Bug  </h1>

<p>Build the connect example.<br/>
Run it.<br/>
Maximize using the box in the upper right corner.<br/>
Double-click the caption bar to restore the regular size.<br/>
The window restores and then immediately maximizes again.<br/>
Then double-click again and it restores properly.<br/>
It should restore on the first double-click.</p>

<h1>Qt 4.1 Release  </h1>

<p>Expect a release by the end of the year.</p>

<h1>Whirlwind Tour through Qt  </h1>

<p>QWidget can be used as an invisible container for a group of<br/>
widgets.</p>

<p>No current replacement for a canvas. Use Q3Canvas for now.<br/>
There will be something new coming in Qt 4.1. (Scene Graph)</p>

<h1>Missing Widgets &amp; Components  </h1>

<p>No rfc822 e-mail components to manage messages or to talk<br/>
with POP3, IMAP, or SMTP servers.</p>

<p>No good “outlook bar”-like widget.</p>

<p>In general the look and feel of the widgets is like the old-<br/>
style windows controls. There does not appear to be any<br/>
support for the new Windows XP themes.</p>

<p>Toolbar support is weak. No indication of the drop zone for<br/>
the toolbar. It doesn’t float either. I’m also not sure if<br/>
the toolbar supports alpha-channel graphics like Windows XP.</p>

<h1>Book Update  </h1>

<p>A version of the book for Qt 4 will be available early next<br/>
year. It will be by the same authors.</p>

<h1>Missing Resources  </h1>

<p>Emphasis is on widgets for GUI design. It would be nice to<br/>
see topics like in the Petzold book that discuss the<br/>
fundamentals of the painting model, events, window<br/>
creation/lifetime, etc. There might be room for a book or<br/>
set of training materials on this. Something like the “MFC<br/>
Internals” book might also be nice to have. Event routing /<br/>
keyboard focus. These are mysterous also.</p>

<h1>Questions  </h1>

<p>Q. How can we route QActions to the proper destination. For<br/>
example, the Edit menu can contain actions for Copy, Cut,<br/>
and Paste. These operations should be routed to the<br/>
currently active widget. If the QActions are hooked up to<br/>
the main window they will not go to the correct destination.<br/>
I suppose you could remap the actions each time the focus<br/>
changes, but this sounds like a brute-force way to<br/>
accomplish this.</p>

<p>A.</p>

<p>Q. Does Qt have a font fallback mechanism?</p>

<p>A. Yes – this is provided by Qt directly since there is no<br/>
reliable fallback mechanism that works across all platforms.</p>

<p>Q.</p>

<h1>Global Event Filters  </h1>

<p>Shoot a Bug</p>

<p>Install a global event filter to dump object information.</p>

<p>// Place before call to app.exec();<br/>
qApp->installEventFilter(new ShootABug());</p>

<p>The Filter class</p>

<p>class ShootABug : public QObject<br/>
{<br/>
public:<br/>
virtual bool eventFilter(… recv …)<br/>
{<br/>
if (event->type() != QEvent::MouseButtonPress)<br/>
return false;<br/>
QMouseEvent* event = static_cats…<br/>
…</p>

<p>// Old way<br/>
qDebug() &lt;objectName().local8Bit();</p>

<p>// New way<br/>
qDebug() &lt;objectName());</p>

<p>qDebug() &lt;metaObject()->className();<br/>
qDebug() &lt;dumpObjectInfo();<br/>
qDebug() &lt;dumpObjectTree()<br/>
}</p>

<h1>repaint() is evil  </h1>

<p>Do not **ever** call repain() yourself. You should be<br/>
calling update() instead. It will handle painting properly<br/>
on all platforms. Update() will invalidate the entire region<br/>
of the widget.</p>

<h1>Visual Studio Debugger  </h1>

<p>Add to Common7\Packages\Debugger\Autoexp.dat to display<br/>
QString in the Visual Studio Debugger.</p>

<p>; from Qt<br/>
QString=data,su></p>

<h1>CEO “Key-note” Presentation  </h1>

<p>Minimize risks<br/>
Future-proof your efforts by using Qt<br/>
Support for Vista is being carefully followed.<br/>
Dual-license also helps minimize risks – source code is<br/>
always available.</p>

<p>All developers at Trolltech are “just like every other<br/>
developer” – they work in offices!</p>

<p>What happened in last 12 months?<br/>
* Grew from 80 to 140 people in 12 months<br/>
* Profitable<br/>
* Second round of funding<br/>
* Established China office<br/>
* Released Qt4</p>

<p>Qt 4 under development for 2 1/2 years.</p>

<p>Next 12 months – what to expect?<br/>
* Professional service organization<br/>
* Chief Technical Officer</p>

<p>Increasing demand for professional services is seen.<br/>
Trolltech is creating a professional services organization.</p>

<p>“Code Less. Create More” — don’t forget that developing<br/>
software should be fun. If development is feeling like a<br/>
slog through the mud then do something different.</p>

<p>Powerful frameworks will help — Qt is such a framework.</p>

<p>UI – Rich or Thin?<br/>
* “You can never be too rich or too thin”<br/>
* QT/COCO -<br/>
– Thin client technology for Qt<br/>
– Install any Qt application on a server<br/>
– Deploy thin, universal client in organization<br/>
– Targeted at enterprise deployment<br/>
– Prototype stage<br/>
– Amazing performance 10x faster than X</p>

<p>This seems kind of like their answer to .NET framework<br/>
ASP.NET thin clients or Java clients.</p>

<p>QT Java Technology<br/>
* Qt/Java bindings<br/>
* Lets java developers use Qt APIs from java env.<br/>
* Under development<br/>
* Prototype Q1 2006</p>

<p>=========================================================</p>

<p>Qt 4 and Beyond<br/>
Matthias Ettrich, VP Engineering</p>

<p>Qt History – 10 years of enabling cross-platform<br/>
- Issolate your code from operating system code.</p>

<p>Qt Evolution<br/>
- Mac is very active platform – driving some changes in Qt 4<br/>
- Vista – Avelon<br/>
- Office 12<br/>
- Linux – kde</p>

<p>Qt 4 Design Goals<br/>
- Enhanced capabilities<br/>
- Greater flexibility<br/>
- Solid foundation for future<br/>
- while retaining a large degree of comapatibility</p>

<p>Qt 4.0 – The good<br/>
- Cusomters and users value the new functionality<br/>
- Clean codebase allows us to turn around quickly<br/>
- Quick adoption in the Open source world<br/>
- Successful and fast ports from Qt 3</p>

<p>Qt 4.0 – The Not So Good<br/>
- A .0 release is a .0 release<br/>
- Some users expressed dissatisfaction with the performance<br/>
of certain painting operations<br/>
- qt3to4 and Qt3Support library partially failed to deliver<br/>
- Qt Designer lacked action editor</p>

<p>Qt 4.1 – The answers<br/>
- Many small bug fixes and imporovements, based on tcustomer<br/>
feedback (Task Tracker)<br/>
- Painting optimizations, including hadrware acceleration<br/>
using OpenGL<br/>
- Highly improved and extended Qt3Support module<br/>
- Enhanced Qt Designer with action editor</p>

<p>4.1 is nearing freeze now. Should be available sometime<br/>
after the Munich dev days event.</p>

<p>Qt 4.0 – Arthur<br/>
Can render SVG!<br/>
Can do native rendering to PDF also!</p>

<p>Qt 4.x Priorities<br/>
- Accomodating Microsoft Visat<br/>
– Scene-based graphics<br/>
- Improving Embedded and Mac<br/>
- Bug fixes, performance improvements<br/>
- Further improvements in At 3 ato Qt 4 migration experimnce<br/>
- New features according to customer needs</p>

<p>Examples<br/>
– Raising abstraction level for dialogs<br/>
– Desktop integration (local browers, local help system,<br/>
system tray, etc.)<br/>
– Higher main window abstraction (MDI, SDI abstraction for<br/>
example)<br/>
– More widgets<br/>
– Help system – framework for context help not there yet.<br/>
– Deployment issues – instalers<br/>
– Component model</p>

<p>THere are many many things they can do. Not sure which ones<br/>
they are actually going to address in Qt 4.x.</p>

<p>Q/A</p>

<ul>
<li>Some solutions not ported from Qt 3 to Qt 4</li>
<li>In Qt3 you could put widgets in a menu. In Qt 4 this is<br/>
not possible. in Qt 4 a more general approach is coming, but<br/>
not ready yet.</li>
</ul>


<p>=========================================================</p>

<p>3/4 billion hand-sets sold</p>

<p>productivity is key – need access to your data from portable<br/>
devices when/where you want.</p>

<p>Qtopia can help bring this level of access to consumers.</p>

<p>New mobile devices have significant headroom for doing other<br/>
things (beyond email/pim, sms, operating system, telephony).<br/>
This is important to recongize. Smart phones are going to be<br/>
very, very smart.</p>

<p>Expect VGA screens, video recorders, high-end audio, 3MP+<br/>
cameras, security, games, etc.</p>

<p>Development of enterprise applications that can run on these<br/>
devices.</p>

<h1>Designing for the Future  </h1>

<p>Things are getting more conneted (dhu!) Consumers expect<br/>
devices to be always connected. They will be smaller,<br/>
lighert, longer life. They will have more MIPS. Better,<br/>
faster, cheaper.</p>

<p>Qt @ Synopsys<br/>
How Synopsys Creates the Best GUIs in EDA</p>

<p>need to focus on how to create consistent (common) look&amp;feel<br/>
across applications becomes critical.</p>

<p>Distinguishes yourself.</p>

<p>Microsoft Office is an example of this. All pieces use<br/>
common UI idioms.</p>

<p>Overview<br/>
- Consolidation is Driving the Software Industry<br/>
- A Short Primer on Common Look and Feel<br/>
- How Synopsys Uses Qt to Achieve the Best GUIs in EDA</p>

<p>Consolidation in the Software Industry<br/>
- customer want less complexity<br/>
- don’t want to build their own mosaic<br/>
- don’t want to buy each title</p>

<p>There is demand for complete easy to use solutions</p>

<p>Prodblems Brought on by Consolidation<br/>
- Diverse appliations used together to solve a larger<br/>
problem.<br/>
S</p>

<p>What is Common Look &amp; Feel?<br/>
- Multiple Products working together.<br/>
– Example is Apple (iPod, iBook, mac mini) – They get<br/>
consistency for user experience<br/>
- Global Optimization for Common Tasks<br/>
– Adobe is a good example with the Creative Suite<br/>
of products. Color selection, layers, etc. are all<br/>
handled the same way. Learn once, apply everywhere.<br/>
- Conscious Commitment to Cross-Product Design<br/>
– Conscious application of systematic design methods to<br/>
a set of products, components, or modules so as to<br/>
maximize their mutual consistency and compatibility<br/>
with one another in support of the designated user and<br/>
task domain. It is the methodology through which<br/>
common look &amp; feel is achieved.</p>

<p>Synopsys<br/>
– Over 1600+ R&amp;D engineers<br/>
– Over 60 offices<br/>
– Over 350 account managers<br/>
– Over 1450+ applications engineers</p>

<p>System Design<br/>
Functional Verification<br/>
Synthesis<br/>
Physical Implementation<br/>
Manufacturing Prep.<br/>
IC Test</p>

<p>Driving Principals:<br/>
– Focus on product suites drive GUI convergence<br/>
– Complexity of IC design drives visual innovations</p>

<p>Background<br/>
– prior to 2001 used MFC for GUI development<br/>
– used porting packages to move to Unix</p>

<p>problems<br/>
– Stability, sensitive to OS patches, high support costs<br/>
– Extendibility , poor modularity and object-oriented<br/>
design<br/>
– not portible, no 64-bit support, no linux support<br/>
– performance, sluggish GUI and graphics performance</p>

<p>We had to find alternative technologies!</p>

<p>So, what GUI technology should we use?<br/>
– Java<br/>
– Motif<br/>
– Tcl/T<br/>
– Gnome<br/>
– Qt</p>

<p>Were excited about Java, but performance was a problem.</p>

<p>Qt was the solution!<br/>
- Performance<br/>
- Platform Support<br/>
- Compatibility C/C++<br/>
- Supply of Developers<br/>
- Object Oriented, modular, extendable<br/>
- Powerful Widgets<br/>
- Short Learning Curve<br/>
- Quality &amp; Support<br/>
- Long Future Lifetime</p>

<p>———-<br/>
How di Synopsys deliver common look &amp; feel?<br/>
- Created EDA specific GUI framework with Qt as the<br/>
foundation<br/>
- Reusable highlevel components &amp; plumbing<br/>
- Specialized centeral organization, distributed product<br/>
focus<br/>
- Requirements driven by products<br/>
- User centered design<br/>
- Structured development methodology.</p>

<p>Qt Components<br/>
- Windowing<br/>
- Tcl Console (they have scripting!)<br/>
- Menus/Toolbars<br/>
-Application Services</p>

<p>Synopsys GUI Organization<br/>
Pros:<br/>
- UI principles promoted from within product team<br/>
- UI reps maintain ties and loyalty to corporate goals<br/>
- UI reps can pull in outside expertise when needed</p>

<p>Cons:<br/>
- Requires maturity from management to resolve conflicts</p>

<p>Did it work? Yes!<br/>
- Gains in efficiency &amp; quality through code reuse<br/>
- Lots of commonality comes for free<br/>
- Designers have more time for unique problems<br/>
- Time to market shorter<br/>
- Common code is practially bullet proof</p>

<p>Qt quality enabled innovation in Visualization!</p>

<p>Feeling is that Synopsys offers superior visualization<br/>
technology for the EDA customer.</p>

<p>State of the art for chip designers hasn’t really changed<br/>
much. (VT100 then –> VT100 terminal emulator window now)</p>

<p>The Visual Information Seeking Mantra:<br/>
- Overview first,<br/>
- Zoom and filter,<br/>
- Then details-on-demand.”</p>

<p>Ben Shneiderman</p>

<p>Modern Screen resolution and graphics per. allow this.</p>

<p>Advantage of Qt<br/>
- Portable across multiple OS config.s<br/>
- High quality<br/>
- Powerful, flexible and extendable building blocks</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>Qt provided Synopsys with a complete, high quality<br/>
foundation<br/>
Synopsys exploited Qt object oritned design<br/>
Resulting in:<br/>
– increased productivity and quality<br/>
– common look &amp; feel across product suites<br/>
– focus on innovative visualtiy</p>

<p>User interface ideas</p>

<p>Put the user in control<br/>
- scriptability<br/>
- plug-ins<br/>
- emulation<br/>
- dynamic interface<br/>
– toolbars<br/>
– user assigned short-cuts<br/>
– user menus<br/>
– user dialogs</p>

<p>Think about the problem you are trying to solve in terms of<br/>
a language. Make it possible to express your solution. This<br/>
is a clarifying way to learn about the problem and solution.</p>

<p>Fit the user’s world<br/>
- import/export<br/>
- scriptability, nternal<br/>
- scriptability, external/system<br/>
- plug-ins<br/>
- special features of the OS</p>

<p>Make sure that the user can fit your application into their<br/>
world. Install/uninstall as expected on each OS. Use<br/>
desktop search capabilities to index your application data<br/>
on each platform (Spotlight on Mac, WinFS on Vista, Google<br/>
desktop Search?)</p>

<p>Use the Network<br/>
- check for updates<br/>
- report crashes<br/>
- on-line help<br/>
- collaboration<br/>
- information from the web</p>

<p>The user community – Transparency<br/>
- public forum<br/>
- public bug database<br/>
- public policies<br/>
– privacy<br/>
– security<br/>
– support<br/>
- blog</p>

<p>Consider Open Source<br/>
- Ccan it fit your licensing model<br/>
- can it fit your development model<br/>
- can you cross the chasm to community interests</p>

<p>Listening<br/>
- making it obvious<br/>
- making it easy<br/>
- what to do with input<br/>
- showing the user you’ve heard</p>

<p>We are good at creating develoment tools because we are the<br/>
users. Listen to the users and then any tool can be as good<br/>
as development tools. The users know what they want, but<br/>
sometimes they say things that are crap/wrong. You must<br/>
separate the good from the bad.</p>

<p>User not using just your program, but also using your<br/>
company. Establishing an on-going relationship with you and<br/>
your company. What you give them should reflect your<br/>
understanding that this is a partnership.</p>

<p>================================================</p>

<p>Threaded Programming – Good Practise<br/>
Andreas Aardal Hanssen</p>

<p>Handout contains examples of threading programming model.<br/>
Kind of like MVC, but for threading.</p>

<p>***| Latency is the enemy, concurrency is king.</p>

<p>Writing threadable code<br/>
- allow objects to live in separate threads, and to be<br/>
used from a different thread<br/>
- write reentrant (or thread-safe) code?<br/>
– preferably no statics<br/>
– standalone objects<br/>
- prefer “reentrancy” over thread-safety</p>

<p>Concurrency is Kin<br/>
- avoid locks where possible<br/>
- lock data, do not lock code<br/>
- free the lock as soon as possible</p>

<p>Lock data, not code<br/>
bad<br/>
mutex.lock()<br/>
words[0].append(“-example.txt”);<br/>
mutex.unlock();</p>

<p>good<br/>
mutex[0].lock();<br/>
words[0].append(“-example.txt”);<br/>
mutex[0].unlock();</p>

<p>Good Threading Models<br/>
- The lazy worker thread (P-C)<br/>
- The single-shot task thread<br/>
- The upside-down parser thread<br/>
- (The extra event loop thread)<br/>
- (The render-ahead thead)<br/>
- (Someone should write a book)</p>

<p>The single-shot task thread<br/>
- Gets job description from the constructor<br/>
- Performs the task immediately in run()<br/>
- Emits done() when done, then exits.</p>

<p>See handout: DataWriter::DataWriter(), Run()</p>

<p>Look up the thread-function adapter design pattern.</p>

<p>The upside-down parser thread<br/>
- A parser in the run() function<br/>
- Calls getChar(), blocks when out of data<br/>
- The parser is “fed” from the main thread through a<br/>
public feed() function<br/>
- Basically P-C in different wrapping</p>

<p>See handout: Tokenizer::feed(), getchar()</p>

<p>Check out QThreadStorage if you want to manage heap more<br/>
efficiently across threads.</p>

<p>===============================</p>

<p>Practical Model View Programming<br/>
Marius Bugge Monsen</p>

<p>Most slides are figures – difficult to take notes – ask for<br/>
a copy of the slides.</p>

<p>Qt 4.1 will have proxy models. This permits sorting and<br/>
filtering to be implemented easily on a per view basis<br/>
without effecting the source model.</p>

<p>In Qt 4.x (4.2 or some other future version) it could be<br/>
possible to aggregate multiple source models into a single<br/>
proxy model.</p>

<p>It would be nice to see an example of a sliding-window model<br/>
that handles looking at n items before/after the current<br/>
window of items. Not sure if this is possible. How would<br/>
this work with views that want to display all items? Is<br/>
there a way to know what the maximum number of items that<br/>
can be displayed in the view is? This would constrain how<br/>
much data must always be present in the sliding-window<br/>
model.</p>

<p>Qt 4.1 should probably be available in next 1-2 months.<br/>
Qt 4.2 is scheduled for late in the first 1/2 of 2006.</p>

<p>=======================================</p>

<p>Writing Plugin Applications with Qt<br/>
And Customizing Qt and Qt Designer</p>

<p>Qt 4 introduces a general framework for writing plugin<br/>
applicaitons</p>

<p>Examples<br/>
- plug &amp; paint applicaiton<br/>
- .cur image handler<br/>
- tic tac toe widget</p>

<p>Next year the offical trolltech Qt 4 book will come out.</p>

<p>Example of .pro file for qmake to build a plugin.</p>

<p>TEMPLATE=lib<br/>
CONFIG += plugin<br/>
INCLUDEPATH += ../..<br/>
HEADERS = …<br/>
SOURCES = …<br/>
TARGET = plugin_name<br/>
DESTDIR = ../../plugandpaint/plugins</p>

<p>No equivalent way to build a plugin from within Visual<br/>
Studio .NET (yet?)</p>
