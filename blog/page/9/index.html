  <div class="entry-content"><p>Computer repair agreements may not always guarantee that you get the old parts back. They also may not guarantee that the replacement parts are new.</p>

<p>When I go to the auto repair shop the paperwork you are asked to sign before the work is started always has a box on it that you can check if you would like to have all of the replaced parts returned to you. And, you always get new parts put on your car unless you make specific arrangements to okay the use of a remanufactured part.</p>

<p>For a car there really isn’t a security risk associated with not getting the original parts back or using remanufactured parts in a repair. With a computer the story is very different. It is commonplace for people to store sensitive information on their personal computer systems. If the hard-drive fails and the computer needs to be taken into the shop for repairs it should not be acceptable for the company doing the repairs to keep your original hard-drive. After all, it contains all sorts of sensitive information that you did not have an opportunity to erase prior to the repair.</p>

<p>Right about now you might be thinking<br/>
Hey, it doesn’t matter to me. The drive is dead. No one can read it, right?<br/>
Well, you would be wrong. Companies that repair these drives do exist, and remanufactured drives are used for repairs of other customer computers.</p>

<p>Just imagine your surprise when the computer you just got repaired now has your neighbor’s hard-drive in it, and the shop didn’t even bother to erase their information before installing it in your machine. Now you have all of their data! Ouch!</p>

<p>Also, the repaired drive in your computer may actually be older than the drive you originally had. It may not be new at all. Given that these drives do have a manufacture rated MTBF (mean-time between failures) that seems to be very accurate, you may be in for another repair within a few weeks or months.</p>

<p>All in all, this practice seems unacceptable on many levels. My suggestion is that whenever your hard-drive fails you should destroy it yourself and should replace it with another one from a reputable supplier. And, you should always make sure the drive is new, not remanufactured!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In order to digitally sign Windows drivers you need what Microsoft called an Authenticode Digital Certificate. The company I work is creating a number of drivers, so we had a need for an Authenticode Digital Certificate. The certificate would also be used to sign the Microsoft installer packages that we release to customers.</p>

<p>Being a cost conscious group we shopped around and identified two main sources for Authenticode digital certificates.</p>

<ul>
<li>VeriSign http://www.verisign.com</li>
<li>Thawte http://www.thawte.com</li>
</ul>


<p>Comparing the prices it seemed clear that the Thawte certificate was a better bet so that is what we purchased. Everything appeared to be fine until we tried to join the WinQual program. That is when I started asking myself the following question:</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: When is an Authenticode Digital Certificate not an Authenticode Digital Certificate?</p>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: When you try and use it in the application process for joining the WinQual program.</p>

<p>In the last couple weeks I have been learning about the requirements to digitally sign Windows device drivers. My strategy has been to take the Toaster sample from Microsoft and try to duplicate all of the steps necessary to build a signed version of the driver. Naively, I figured it should be easy to replicate the steps taken by Microsoft to sign this sample program. Boy was I wrong!</p>

<p>It turns out that there is a utility called inf2cat or something like that. Microsoft recommends using it to create the category file containing hashes of the files you want digitally signed as part of your driver package. So, for me to replicate the Toaster sample signing process I need a copy of inf2cat. This tool is apparently only available to members of the WinQual program that Microsoft runs.</p>

<p>Okay, so I need to join WinQual. How hard could that be. I went to https://winqual.microsoft.com and learned that in order to joint he program you must submit a file to them that is digitally signed with your Authenticode certificate. So off I went to get an Authenticode certificate for my company. After a few google searches I came to the conclusion that VeriSign and Thawte are the two primary sources for these certificates, and Thawte is considerably cheaper. I purchased an Authenticode certificate from Thawte and a few days later the certificate was on my machine and it was time to make the membership request on the WinQual site.</p>

<p>I followed all of the instructions to digitally sign the required file using my new Authenticode certificate. Everything seemed to go smoothly until I tried to upload the signed file to Microsoft. Their web site kept saying that the file was not signed correctly. I went back to the main WinQual web page to try and find an answer to this problem. There was nothing there to help me solve this mystery so I went to the only other resource I could think of. That is the DDK mailing list archives at OSR. These folks have been doing Windows driver work for ages and if anyone knew what was wrong, I was sure the answers would be on their mailing list.</p>

<p>It only took one keyword search of the archives to learn what the problem was. It seems that not all Authenticode digital certificates are created equal, and Microsoft has a predilection to those minted by VeriSign. My new Thawte digital certificate would be just fine for signing my drivers, but it would not be at all useful in joining the WinQual program. It was beginning to look like I needed to buy another Authenticode certificate from VeriSign in order to join the WinQual program.</p>

<p>After carefully re-reading the WinQual page describing the ways to join the program I learned that you could also sign your membership request using something called a Corporate Identifier. It was a cheaper, less capable digital certificate that could be used to sign the file and join the program. This certificate could be purchased from VeriSign for $99.</p>

<p>I waited another couple days and the new Corporate Identifier finally appeared in my inbox. I followed the instructions to sign the file, upload it, and this time I met with success in joining the WinQual program.</p>

<p>So, instead of saving money by using the Thawte certificate I ended up spending roughly the same amount of money that it would have cost to just purchase the Authenticode certificate from VeriSign. The difference was that because the WinQual site was not clear on the specific requirements for using a VeriSign certificate I ended up wasting at least 2 or 3 days trying to join the WinQual program.</p>

<p>In the end it was clear that I should have purchased the “name brand” digital certificate from VeriSign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you would like to capture a log of everything that GDB displays during a debugging session you can do the following:<br/>
<code>&lt;br /&gt;
$ defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXGDBDebuggerLogToFile YES&lt;br /&gt;
</code><br/>
The statement above will turn on logging to a file. Now, you need to set the filename for the debugger output file. Use the following statement to accomplish that.<br/>
<code>&lt;br /&gt;
$ defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXGDBDebuggerLogFileName /tmp/gdboutput.log&lt;br /&gt;
</code><br/>
This will create a file in the /tmp directory called gdboutput.log, containing everything you see in the GDB command window during your debugging session.</p>

<p>Both of these commands need to be typed into a Terminal.app window. You only need to do this once, as your machine will remember the settings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Mac OS Tiger introduced a new daemon control application called launchd. This application is supposed to take the place of rc scripts, xinitd scripts, and cron jobs. The launchd process is configured using XML text files that conform to the Apple plist DTD. Perforce does not provide a sample launchd configuration file for the p4d daemon.</p>

<p>The following is an example of how I configured p4d to run on my Tiger server. Be sure to edit it appropriately for your server configuration.</p>

<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
                        "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;GroupName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;perforce&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.perforce.p4d&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;OnDemand&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;false/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/p4d&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/p4d&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-r&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/Depot&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-p&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;1666&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-J&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/Depot/journal&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;-L&lt;/string&gt;
        &lt;string&gt;/Depot/p4err&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;true/&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;ServiceDescription&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;Perforce Daemon&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/Depot/p4d.stderr.txt&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/Depot/p4d.stdout.txt&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;p4admin&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;/Depot&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</pre>


<p>I place this file in the directory /Library/LaunchDaemons, and is named perforce.plist. The permissions look like this:</p>

<pre>-rw-r-----    1 root  wheel   1012 Jan  5 22:21 perforce.plist
</pre>


<p>You will need to tell launchd about the new plist by running:</p>

<pre>$ sudo launchctl load perforce.plist
</pre>


<p>from the /Library/LaunchDaemons directory. To confirm that the new plist has been loaded correctly you can run this command:</p>

<pre>$ sudo launchctl list
</pre>


<p>The list produced should contain a line that says com.perforce.p4d. That is the name given to the new plist for the p4d application.<br/>
At this point you should see a p4d process if you run</p>

<pre>$ ps -aux
</pre>


<p>There should only be one of this process running, and it is the daemon controlling your Perforce server installation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. EXPECT UPDATES AND DON’T BE SURPRISED BY INCOMPLETE INFORMATION</em><span class="alignright"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.trolltech.com"><img src="http://idvlpsw.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/qt.png" alt="qtlogo_feature.png" border="0" /></a></span></p>

<p>Trolltech has released Qt 4 under a dual-license for all supported platforms. In earlier versions of Qt they only released the open source version for Mac and Linux, leaving Windows developers with no choice but to purchase a commercial license. That all changed with the release of Qt 4 when Trolltech started to provide an open source version for Windows development too! The only catch was that Trolltech only supports the MinGW GCC compiler for development using the open source version.</p>

<p>This article describes how to patch Qt 4 open source edition on Windows so you can develop using Visual Studio 2005. You can even develop using the free Express edition of Visual Studio 2005 so long as you also install the latest Platform SDK.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these patches and tips are not provided so you can get around the very generous Trolltech dual-license terms of use. If you are developing or intend to develop a commercial application using Qt 4 you must purchase a commercial license for Qt 4. Only use the information provided in this article if you wish to develop open source GPL software for the Windows platform and wish to use the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 compiler instead of the MinGW GCC compiler.</p>

<h2>Download Qt 4.1 Source Code, Patches, and Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Download the latest open source Windows version of Qt 4.1 from Trolltech at http://www.trolltech.com/download/qt/windows.html. Unzip the file to C:. It will extract all of the files into a sub-directory called qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0.</li>
<li>Download the latest patch file used to modify the open source version of Qt 4.1 to support Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 from Source Forge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/qtwin/. Unzip the file to C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0.</li>
<li>Download the build script, environment setup and notes from http://www.idevelopsoftware.com/downloads/qt/Qt41WinBuildScript.zip. Unzip the file to C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0.</li>
<li><p>If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2005 you can download the Express edition. You will also need to download the Platform SDK.

</ul>


<h2>Building Qt 4.1 using Visual C++ 2005</h2>

<p>Open C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0 in Windows Explorer.<br/>
Double-click on the “Qt 4.1 Command Prompt” shortcut to open a Command Prompt window with the environment setup for Qt 4.1 development. IMPORTANT: You must already have Visual Studio 2005 installed. You may need to edit setenv.cmd if your copy of Visual Studio 2005 is not in the default location.</p>

<p>Run “installpatch41.bat”<br/>
This will patch the Qt 4.1 source code so it builds properly using the Visual C++ 2005 compiler.</p>

<p>Run “build.cmd”<br/>
This will build all of the Qt 4.1 libraries, utilities, and sample applications using the Visual C++ 2005 compiler.</p>

<p>To rebuild, if necessary, make sure to first clean up the previous build. Do this by running<br/>
nmake distclean</p>

<p>from the C:\qt-win-opensource-src-4.1.0 directory.</p>

<p>External Tools Configuration in Visual Studio 2005</p>

Select the “Commands” tab on the “Customize” dialog. Select “Tools” from the “Categories:” list. Scroll down in the “Commands:” list until you see “External Command 7″. Drag commands 7, 8, 9, and 10 onto the new “Qt 4.1 Development” toolbar.<br/>
Creating a New Visual Studio 2005 Project</p>

<p>Open the “New Project” dialog by selecting File->New->Project… from the menu. Under “Project types” on the left side of the dialog expand “Visual C++” and then select “General.” The right side of the dialog will display a list of all the general project types. Select “Makefile Project” from the list of project types. Provide a name for the project and set the location on disk where you wish the project to be saved. Be sure not to check “Create directory for solution”, as this will create an extra level of directories that is just confusing. Click the “OK” button and you will be presented with the “Makefile Application Wizard.” Simply press the “Finish” button on the first page of the wizard.</p>

<p>Once the project has been created and opened, set the NMake Configuration Properties for the project as shown below. In the “Solution Explorer” right-click on the name of your project. Select “Properties…” from the context menu. On the property pages dialog select “Configuration Properties” and “NMake” on the left side tree control.

<p>Create a project file called “foo.pro” in the directory for your makefile project. Replace the name “foo.pro” with the name of your actual application. Place the file in the directory where your Visual Studio project was created. To start with, the contents might look something like this:</p>

<p>CONFIG += qt<br/>
TEMPLATE = app<br/>
SOURCES += foo.cpp<br/>
HEADERS += foo.h<br/>
FORMS += foo.ui<br/>
You should be off and running now. For more detailed information I would suggest reading the qmake reference manual. You might also want to take a look at the Qt 4.1 tutorials in Qt Assistant. Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A typical configuration of Perforce is handled by setting the P4PORT, P4USER and P4CLIENT environment variables. These variables point at the desired depot, identify the user and select a client workspace.</p>

<p>To quickly switch between different depots or client workspaces I make sure the P4CONFIG environment variable specifies the name of a configuration file. On my Windows XP system this is done by running the command p4 set P4CONFIG=p4config.txt. The p4 command will recognize that this variable is set and will attempt to locate a configuration file each time it is launched. The search begins in the current directory and searches all parent directories until it reaches the root directory for the current drive.</p>

<p>I place a p4config.txt file in each workspace root directory. The file is formatted as a series of lines where each line contains name=value. For example, one of my p4config.txt files looks like this:</p>

<p>P4CLIENT=bsmith_pc<br/>
P4EDITOR=C:\Program Files\Vim\vim63\vim.exe<br/>
P4PORT=perforce.mysite.com:1666<br/>
P4USER=bsmith</p>

<p>My installation of Perforce is configured to use the ticket-based authentication system so I can login to the depot by issuing the p4 login command from a directory below the workspace root. I will be prompted for the password and a ticket will be issued. From this point on I can simply issue p4 commands and the appropriate depot and workspace will be automatically selected.</p>

<p>This technique can be applied to multiple client workspaces at the same time by setting up multiple p4config.txt files and logging into each depot. Then it is a simple matter of changing directories in my command window to switch between depots and/or client workspaces.</p>

<p>On Unix and Mac OS X I set P4CONFIG to point at a file called @.p4config@. The file contents are similar to the Windows example earlier in this post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Download the latest version of Perforce from their web site (http://www.perforce.com). To setup the server you really only need to download the command-line tools p4 and p4d. Here are links to the versions I used when setting up my server in January 2006.</p>

<p>http://www.perforce.com/downloads/perforce/r05.2/bin.macosx102ppc/p4</p>

<p>http://www.perforce.com/downloads/perforce/r05.2/bin.darwin60ppc/p4d</p>

<p>You may also wish to install the graphical tools P4V and P4Merge. These are part of a single disk image.</p>

<p>http://www.perforce.com/downloads/perforce/r05.2/bin.macosx102ppc/P4V.dmg</p>

<p>Perforce recommends that p4d not be run as root so I created a new user account called p4admin. I also created a new group called perforce. I decided to install the software in the /usr/local/bin directory and to place the depot on a separate drive that is mounted under the /Depot directory.</p>

<p>Automatically starting p4d when the system boots is handled through the utility launchd. Configuring this is done by editing a plist file and then loading it with the utility launchctl. Attached is a copy of the plist file I used. I placed the plist file in the directory /Library/LaunchDaemons. The file is called perforce.plist.</p>

<p>Once the file exists use the launchctl application to tell the launchd program about it. The command I used was:</p>

<p>$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/perforce.plist</p>

<p>If you make changes to the plist file and want to reload it use the command below to unload the existing one. Then repeat the above command to load the changed plist.</p>

<p>$ sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/perforce.plist</p>

<p>Perforce recommends setting up a regular job to create a checkpoint and a backup of the depot. The script p4backup illustrates how to handle this. Use the p4backup.plist file to teach launchd about this script so it will run on a regular basis. On my server I run this script every night. The backup is done using a copy from the /Depot directory to the /Depot.Backup directory, which is on a separate filesystem.</p>

<p>perforce.plist GroupName perforce Label com.perforce.p4d OnDemand Program /usr/local/bin/p4d ProgramArguments /usr/local/bin/p4d -r /Depot -p 1666 -J /Depot/journal -L /Depot/p4err RunAtLoad ServiceDescription Perforce Daemon StandardErrorPath /Depot/p4d.stderr.txt StandardOutPath /Depot/p4d.stdout.txt UserName p4admin WorkingDirectory /Depot</p>
